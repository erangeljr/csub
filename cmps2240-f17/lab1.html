<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
<pre class="thin_border">
All of your work for the semester will be kept in specific directories on the Sleipnir server.
To create the area, first log in to sleipnir, then do the commands below.
<pre class="console">

$ cd
$ /home/stu/erangel/courses/2240/build_dirs.sh

</pre>Your directory structure is now setup.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>Goals</b>:<br>
Understand the structure of a MIPS program.<br>
Understand how to use SPIM.<br>
Write a MIPS program to sum two integers and display a result.

<b>Files Needed</b>:<br>
Example programs for today's lab: <a href="code/lab1/">Lab1</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>If You Do Not Finish</b>:<br>

</p>

<p>
Even if you finish during the lab period, your code must be located in the
correct directory on Sleipnir.
</p>

<p>
<b>Background:</b>
We will use a MIPS simulator (SPIM) in this course.  We must use a simulator
because you are most likely using a machine with an x86-64 microprocessor.
SPIM is installed on Sleipnir but you can also download SPIM for your home
machine (see Resources above). SPIM is not an assembler; i.e., SPIM does not
create an executable file in machine code. SPIM translates MIPS line by line,
similar to how an interpreter runs code. Because of this, SPIM is a good
learning environment.
</p>

<p>
<b>Downloading Files Needed:</b>
Typically you will be given some files to start the lab. If you're on
your own machine you can download them from the address above. If you're using
a UNIX terminal on Sleipner, you can copy files into your local directory
with the following command:
</p>
<p>
<b>scp -r /home/stu/erangel/public_html/cmps2240-f17/code/lab1/* .</b>
</p>
<p>
which will copy the /lab1/ directory to your current directory.
Or, if you're in the terminal but on your own machine not on the network:
</p>
<p>
<b>scp -r <i>name</i>@sleipnir.cs.csubak.edu:/home/stu/erangel/public_html/cmps2240-f17/code/lab1/* .</b>
</p>
<p>
replace <i>name</i> with your own user name.
</p>

<h3>hello.s</h3>
You will learn MIPS well in the coming weeks. This lab introduces you to a
few of the basics. The code below from <a href="code/lab1/hello.s">hello.s</a> is a good place to start:
<p>
<pre class="box_border">

# hello.s
# a sample MIPS program to demonstrate MIPS basics 
# Usage: $ spim -f hello.s

        .data                # data segment begins here
stuff:  .asciiz "Hello World!\n"

        .text                # code segment begins here 
main:
        la $a0, stuff
        li $v0, 4            # 4 is syscall to print a string
        syscall              # execute the call 

        li $a0, 10           # 10 is ascii value for linefeed
        li $v0, 11           # 11 is syscall to print char
        syscall

        li $v0, 10           # 10 is system call to exit
        syscall              # execute the call 

</pre>
</p>
<p>There is no strict convention on the extension of a MIPS source code. You might see .s or .asm or .nasm or something else. We will use .s in this class since s is the first letter of both short and sweet.
</p>
<p>
The source code above has two sections, a data section and a text section.
Everything is in one section or the other.
</p>
<p>
Comments are prefixed with a hash # everything to the end of the line past the
hash is ignored by the assembler. The data section holds literals such as the
"Hello World!" string. The text section contains instructions and assembler
directives. Instructions are in the form of an opcode (operation code) followed
by zero, one, two or three arguments for that opcode.  The amount of whitespace
between opcodes and arguments is irrelevant.  An argument for a MIPS
instruction is either a register, a literal, or an address. An address is
marked by a label.  E.g.,stuff.  A literal is a number, e.g. 4, 10 or 11.
</p>

<p>
<b>Registers and Memory:</b>
A register is special storage on the microprocessor.  This is opposed to
variables stored in memory, which must be defined in the .data section. For
more on this, read: <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m29470/1.1/">http://cnx.org/content/m29470/1.1/</a>.
</p>
<p>
In short, data is stored in either a register or in memory. Registers are very
fast but limited in number and restricted to word-length.  Memory is abundant
for our purposes, is not necessarily restricted to word length, but is slower.
Additionally, in MIPS, most operations operate on registers. If you want to add
two values in memory you would need to issue commands to bring them from
memory, place them in registers, then carry out your operation. In MIPS, a
register can hold either a value or an address. The meaning of the data in the
register is determined by its context in the instruction. It is up to you to
keep track of whether a register holds an address or a value.
</p>

<p>
<b>Load Address:</b>
Some MIPS instructions are not part of the MIPS instruction set architecture
(the hardware) but are provided by the assembler to make the programmer's life
a little easier.  These instructions are called pseudo-instructions. Each
pseudo-instruction is a macro for 2 or more instructions from the ISA.
Load address, la, is a MIPS instruction that stuffs the address of a label into
a register; e.g.:
</p>
<pre><b>la $a0, format        #load address of label format into $a0
</b></pre>
<p>
The two arguments for la specify the movement of data from memory (the source)
to a register (the target). The movement is right to left.  Be careful not to
confuse the two.  The target comes before the source (but only for load
operations). Thus a LOAD always reads like an assignment statement in a
high-level language.
</p>
<p>
<b>Store:</b>
In the coming weeks we will also cover STORE operations. Unlike 80x86 (which
we will cover in week 8), MIPS is a LOAD/STORE architecture. This means that
computations cannot be done directly to values in memory. Data must always be
read from memory into a register (LOAD) or written to memory from a register
(STORE). This makes instructions simple since the first argument in a load
instruction is always the target register. The first argument in a store is the
source register. While the flow of data in a LOAD instruction is logically
right to left (load the address of "Hello World!\n" into register a0), the flow
of data in a STORE instructions is logically left to right:
</p>
<p>
sw $a0, $t0      # store value in $a0 to address in $t0
</p>

<p>
<b>Load Immediate</b>
The load immediate, li, is also a pseudo-instruction that loads the numeric
constant 10 (source) into the target register $v0.
</p>

<p>
<b>syscall</b>
The <i>syscall</i> instruction executes a system call identified by the integer value in register $v0. In this case '10' is the exit call. Different values placed in $v0 will cause different behavior. <i>syscall</i> can print strings, read strings, print integers, exit, etc.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Run hello.s</h3>
Understanding the above concepts will be enough to complete this lab. If you
desire more details, browse through A-43 through A-81 of appendix-A link on our home page, for a table of syscall codes, assembler directives and a reference of
MIPS R2000 Assembly Language instructions. Get SPIM if you don't already have
it and run hello.s. Make sure you understand what each line does in the code.
You do not need to check this off with the instructor.
</p>

<p>
<h3>What to turn in</h3>
<pre>
Your lab program <i><b>yourname_hello.s</b></i> must be located in the correct directory on Sleipnir.

directory name: /home/stu/<i><b>yourname</b></i>/2240/1/

Replace <i>yourname</i> with your own Sleipnir username!
