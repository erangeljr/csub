<h3>CMPS-2240 Laboratory Assignments</h3>
Laboratory Assignments are designed to give you a quick hands-on experience, while receiving
feedback and help from the instructor and teaching assistants.
<p>
<b>Program Naming</b><br>
Each lab assignment will designate a filename to use.<br>
<br>
For example, Lab-1 program will be named lab1.s
No caps.<br>
<br>
<b>Program Comments</b><br>
Every program you write for me will have a comment section at the top,
similar to the example below.
