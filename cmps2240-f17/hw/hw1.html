		<h3>Homework Set 1</h3>
<pre>
You are free to use any resources at your disposal to answer the homework.
However, directly copying answers from online sources is plagiarism.
You must show your work for problems 6-9.
Unsupported answers will be given a zero grade.

1. What is the difference between a high level language and a low level
   language?

2. What is a mnemonic?

3. A program is translated to machine code for a computer with an Intel x86
   microprocessor. Will this code run on a machine with a MIPS microprocessor?
   Explain your answer.

4. What is the difference between reduced instruction set computing and complex
   instruction set computing?

5. A microprocessor is designed to receive specific instructions, and the set
   of these instructions are referred to as an Instruction Set Architecture
   (ISA). One such architecture is MIPS. Find 3 other ISAs and describe them.

6. Convert the following numbers to binary:
        A. 128
        B. 399
        C. 271

7. Convert the following numbers to hexadecimal:
        A. 10
        B. 233
        C. 199

8. Convert the following numbers to decimal:
        A. 1001 1001
        B. 1010 0000
        C. 0xFF

9. Perform these binary operations. Then convert the binary results into decimal.          

  1011        1110       0111 0111        1100  
+ 1110      - 1011     + 0000 1011      - 0101
  ----        ----       ---------        ---- 

10. Compute these bitwise logical operations. 
	This is C syntax: '&' is bitwise AND; '|' is bitwise OR; '^' is bitwise XOR; '~' is NOT.           
	
  11100       11010       11001   ~1     ~0     
& 10101     | 10001     ^ 10010   --     --
  -----       -----       -----
