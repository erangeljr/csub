		<h3>Homework Set 6</h3>
<pre>
Rules from previous homework sets apply.

1. What is the purpose of the branch delay slot?

2. The following questions pertains to what can or cannot be placed in a
   branch delay slot.
       A. Give examples of instructions that can be placed in a
          branch delay slot.
       B. Give examples of instructions that CANNOT be placed in a
          branch delay slot.
       C. Describe what happens if a branch is placed in a branch delay slot.

3. What value will be in $t1 after this loop executes 5 times?

          move $t1, $zero
    loop:
          sll $zero, $zero, 0
          j loop
          addiu $t1, $t1, 1 

4. In addition to branch instructions, load instructions are followed by a
   delay slot. Why do you think this is?

5. Given the following chunk of MIPS code, can any instruction be safely placed
   in the branch delay slot? Or must you use a noop?

      li $7, 10
      move $8, $zero
      slt $9, $8, $7
      beqz $9, done
      branch delay slot
      ...more code ...
      done:
      li $v0, 10
      syscall
