		<h3>Homework Set 3</h3>
<pre>
Same rules as previous homework set apply.

1. Using the power rule, calculate the range of values that can be represented
   by an n bit two's compliment integer.

2. Give MIPS code that calls the subroutine foo ten times.
   You should use branching to do this.

3. (6 points) Give MIPS code for a subroutine that checks if a signed integer
   is positive. It returns 0 if it is positive. It returns 1 if it is not.
   The integer is given in $a0. Return the value in $v0. You must use stack
   based linkage.

4. Consider the MIPS instruction 0x3C049000.

   A. If this instruction begins at 0x00400000, how is it stored in
      big endian format?

   B. Repeat 4.1. for little endian format.

5. (9 points) Write code in MIPs that stores the first 30 values of the
   following equation in memory, starting from x = 0:

    f(x) = x + 4

   You should use a loop to iterate over values of x and store the result
   into memory.
