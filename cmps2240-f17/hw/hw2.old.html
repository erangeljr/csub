		<h3>Homework Set 2</h3>
<pre>
You are free to use any resources at your disposal to answer the homework.
However, directly copying answers from online sources is plagiarism.
Unsupported answers will be given a zero grade.
(#5 and #6 are 6-points each)

1. Discuss how each of the following MIPS commands modifies the program counter:
    A. jr
    B. jal
    C. j

2. Consider the following MIPS source code:

    main:            # Begin main
    add $t0 $t1 $t2  # Add two registers
    jr myfun         # Jump to my function

    ...

    myfun:           # Begin myfun
    addi $t0 $t1 1   # Add 1
    jr $ra

    Upon reaching "..." the code should store t1 + t2 + 1 in register t0.
    If there are errors, discuss how this code could be fixed.


3. Consider the J-type operation j. Calculate the maximum jump distance from
   the current program counter.


4. Carry out the following expressions, unsigned, limited to 12 bits:

    A. 0xFFF + 0x001
    B. 0xFFAC + 0xDA98
    C. 0b000011100000 + 0b010111111101

5. Give MIPS code for a subroutine <i>getint</i> that reads an integer from the
   keyboard, echos it to the display and stores the result into $v0.

6. Give MIPS code for a subroutine <i>toneg</i> that takes the value in $a0 and
   converts it to negative two's compliment. Assume that the value in $a0 is
   positive (don't do any input error checking). Store the result into $v0.
