		<h3>Homework Set 8</h3>
<pre>
All rules from previous homework sets apply.

1. Describe how general purpose registers differ from MIPS to x86

2. Describe how instruction operands differ from MIPS to x86

3. Describe how setting up a call frame differs from MIPS to x86

4. Describe how passing arguments to a subroutine differs from MIPS to x86

5. For each of the following x86 registers, describe its use:
       A. EFLAGS
       B. EIP
       C. EBP

6. Give complete x86 code for a subroutine that divides by 2. It takes a single
   unsigned integer as an argument. Follow CDECL calling convention.

7. Give complete x86 code for a subroutine that returns 1 if the number is
   positive and 0 if the number is negative. It takes a single unsigned integer
   as an argument. Follow CDECL calling convention.
