		<h3>Homework Set 7</h3>
<pre>
Rules from previous homework sets apply.

1. Explain why a zero-valued register is not required for floating point
   operations.

2. Consider the following operation:

      add.s $f0 $f1 $a0

   that mixes integers and floating points. What are the problems with carrying
   out this instruction?

3. Write a complete MIPS program that prompts for two floating point numbers,
   adds them and finally displays the result.

4. What is the difference between an exception and an interrupt?

5. How can a floating point overflow?

6. Consider two processors.
   Processor A is highly pipelined with a CPI of 0.2 and a frequency of 200MHz.
   Processor B has a CPI of 1.5 and a frequency of 1 GHz.
   Given the same program, which is faster?
