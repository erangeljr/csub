		<h3>Homework Set 9</h3>
<pre>
Rules from provious homework sets apply.

This homework set is about Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), which is different from
MIPS and x86. It's very likely that you own an ARM microprocessor (your cell
phone). When answering these questions, please be sure to compare the ISA to
x86 and MIPS. Draw a conclusion which ISA ARM is most similar to. Two links
have been given on the Moodle page for the course that you should read. Feel
free to find other resources (internet or otherwise). It goes without saying
that you can not directly copy text from these sources. Your work should be
in its own words. I expect 3-6 sentences for each answer.

   1. Describe the general purpose registers

   2. Describe instruction operand size, and operations

   3. Describe the ALU operations available

   4. Are you allowed to mix memory and registers in a single operation?

   5. Describe branching

   6. Is ARM RISC, CISC or does it share traits of both paradigms?
