Scores will be posted on the course website during the quarter. 

<p>
<b>Labs</b><br>
Lab assignments ask you to write some assembly language programs in class.
There will usually be a brief lecture at the beginning of each lab session.
Roll will be taken during lab. 10% of the lab grade is based on attendance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab Submission</b><br>
All lab files due should be located in your designated folder on Sleipnir.<br>
This area on the Sleipnir server will be set up for you during the 1st week
of class.<br>
Instructions will be gived during the course to help you submit your
assignments correctly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework</b><br>
Homework assignments are posted on our web page. Please work out the problems
on paper with a pencil and eraser. Homeworks are due on Fridays just prior to
the weekly quiz.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late Policy</b><br>
Late assignments will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Quiz</b><br>
The final quiz will be given during finals week, and be similar to the
other quizzes given during the quarter.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Project</b><br>
The final project will ask you to write a somewhat complex program using all
the assembly language knowledge you have learned throughout this course.
</p>

<p>
A complete description of the project requirements will be available around
week-5 of the course. The project could take 20 to 40 hours of programming
work to complete, depending upon the grade level you wish to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<b>Individual Work Policy</b><br>
All work done in this course is individual work.
Study groups are encouraged, but working together with another student
or students on an assignment is not acceptable.
</p>
<p>
Copying another student's work is plagiarism.
Copying answers or source code from the Internet is also plagiarism.
Asking a tutor or another person to do your work for you is cheating.
</p>
<p>
Do your own work please.<br>
If you are struggling to learn the material, then do the following:<br>
 1. Complete all the reading assignments.<br>
 2. Ask the tutors some specific questions about what you're stuck on.<br>
 3. Come to every class session.<br>
 4. Practice your programming every day.<br>
</p>
