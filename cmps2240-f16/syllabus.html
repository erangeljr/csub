<p>
<b>Labs</b><br>
Lab assignments ask you to write some assembly language programs in class.
There will usually be a brief lecture at the beginning of each lab session.
Roll will be taken during lab. 20% of the lab grade is based on attendance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab Submission</b><br>
All lab files due should be located in your designated folder on Sleipnir.<br>
This area on the Sleipnir server will be set up for you during the 1st week
of class.<br>
Instructions will be gived during the course to help you submit your
assignments correctly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework</b><br>
Homework assignments are posted on our web page. Please work out the problems
on paper with a pencil and eraser. Homeworks are due on Fridays just prior to
the weekly quiz.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late Policy</b><br>
Late assignments will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Exam</b><br>
The final exam will be given during finals week, and be similar to the
quizzes given during the quarter.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Project</b><br>
The final project will ask you to write a somewhat complex program using all
the assembly language knowledge you have learned throughout this course.
</p>

<p>
A complete description of the project requirements will be available around
week-8 of the course. The project could take 20 to 40 hours of programming
work to complete, depending upon the grade level you wish to achieve.
