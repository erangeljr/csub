<b>Catalog Description</b><br>
Discrete structures and applications in computer science. Provides an introduction to proof techniques, 
        propositional and predicate logic, functions, relations, sets, big-oh notation, counting techniques, 
        summations, recursive definitions, recurrence relations, discrete probability and simple circuit logic. 
        CMPS 2010 or CMPS 2020 with a grade of C- or better; MATH 1040 or MATH 1050
</p>
<p> This course covers the following ACM/IEEE Body of Knowledge student learning
        outcomes:
    <p>
        CC-DS: Discrete Structures<br>
        CC-AL: Algorithms and Complexity<br>
        CE-DSC Discrete Structures<br>
    </p>
</p>    
<p>
    The course maps to the following program/student outcomes for 
    Computer Science (CAC/ABET) and Computer Engineering (EAC/ABET):<br>
    <br>
    (CAC PIa5, EAC PIa5): Use discrete mathematics techniques and algorithms.<br>
    Assessed by question on final exam.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Labs</b><br>
Lab assignments ask you to write some assembly language programs in class.
There will usually be a brief lecture at the beginning of each lab session.
Roll will be taken during lab. 20% of the lab grade is based on attendance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab Submission</b><br>
All lab files due should be located in your designated folder on Sleipnir.<br>
This area on the Sleipnir server will be set up for you during the 1st week
of class.<br>
Instructions will be gived during the course to help you submit your
assignments correctly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework</b><br>
Homework assignments are posted on our web page. Please work out the problems
on paper with a pencil and eraser. Homeworks are due on Fridays just prior to
the weekly quiz.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late Policy</b><br>
Late assignments will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Exam</b><br>
The final exam will be given during finals week, and be similar to the
quizzes given during the quarter.
</p>

<p>
<b>Individual Work Policy</b><br>
All work done in this course is individual work.<br>
Sharing of code is not acceptable.<br>
Possession of code written by other students in not acceptable.<br>
Copying another student's work is plagiarism.<br>
Copying answers or source code from the Internet is also plagiarism.<br>
Asking a tutor or another person to do your work for you is cheating.<br>
</p>
<p>
Do your own work please.<br>
If you are struggling to learn the material, then do the following:<br>
 1. Complete all the reading assignments.<br>
 2. Ask the tutors some specific questions about what you're stuck on.<br>
 3. Come to every class session.<br>
 4. Practice your programming every day.<br>
 5. Contact the instructor for help.<br>
