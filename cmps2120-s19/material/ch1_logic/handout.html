ARITHMETIC RULES<br/>
m,n,k,q,x,y are integers<br/>
</th>
<tr><td><tt>
<p>
<li> Notation: mod and % denote the modulo operator for modular arithmetic<p/>
<li> Notation: n^x means n raised to the power of x<p>
<li> x &equiv; y reads "x is congruent to y"<p>
<li> Parity refers to the even/odd property of an integer; e.g., 2 has even parity <p>
<li> n is even if and only if n = 2k, for some k.<p>
<li>
n is odd if and only if n = 2k + 1, for some k.<p>

<li> (k)(k+1) is even and k + (k+1) is odd. <p>
<li> (2k+1)(2k) is even and (2k+1)+(2k) is odd. <p>

<li> m mod n is the positive remainder of m/n.<p>

<li> m mod n = m - nq, for some q >=0.<p>

<li> If m < n, then m mod n = m; e.g., 4 mod 10 = 4.<p>

<li> m mod 1 = 0; e.g., 4 mod 1 = 0.<p>

<li> If m and n are congruent mod x then (m mod x) = (n mod x). <p>
<li>
If m and n are congruent to 0 mod d, then m=dk and n=dj, for some k and j.<p>
<li>
If m and n are congruent to each other mod 2, then m and n share parity.<p>

<li> (x + y) mod m = ((x mod m) + (y mod m)) mod m.  <p>
<li> (xy) mod m = ((x mod m)(y mod m)) mod m. <p>

<li> If n is not divisable by 3 then n=3k+1 or n=3k+2, for some k. <p>

<li> If n is composite then n = pq, for some p and q > 1.  <p>

<li> If n is prime then there are no factors in n other than 1 and n.  <p>

<li> If n is rational then n can be expressed as x/y, for
 y > 0 and where x and y are relatively prime. <p>

<li> x and y are relatively prime if they share no common factor other than 1.  <p>
<li> If d is a factor of n, then n = dk, for some k.
