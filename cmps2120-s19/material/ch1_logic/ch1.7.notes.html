<b>EXAMPLE 1</b>

Show: If a != b, and a and b are real numbers, then (a + b)/2 > sqrt(ab).

Step 1. Remove division and sqrt operators to make inequality easier to work with.

       (a + b)/2 > sqrt(ab)
       (a + b) > 2(sqrt(ab))
       (a + b)^2 > 2(sqrt(ab))^2
       (a + b)^2 > 4ab

Step 2. Make one side of the inequality zero. Why? Because you can more easily
        show that something is > 0.

       (a + b)^2 > 4ab
       (a + b)^2 - 4ab > 4ab - 4ab
        a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 4ab > 0 

Step 3. Simplify.
 
       a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 4ab > 0 
       a^2 - 2ab + b^2 > 0 
       (a-b)(a-b) > 0 
       (a-b)^2 > 0 

Step 4. <b>Proof by cases</b>.
        By problem definition, a != b. Thus a-b will never be zero.

        Case 1. a-b is some real number less than zero.
        Then (a-b)^2 will be a positive number thus greater than zero.

        Case 2. a-b is some real number greater than zero.
        Then (a-b)^2 will be a positive number thus greater than zero.

        Thus, (a-b)^2 will always be > 0. qed.


<b>EXAMPLE 2</b>

Provide a <b>proof by contradiction</b> to show that any integer of the form k(k+1) 
has a factor of 2 (i.e., the product of consecutive integers is even). 

Restated as an implication:

     "If n = k(k+1) then n is even."

Try to show n = k(k+1) and n is odd.
      
If n is odd then k(k+1) does not have a factor of 2. Then neither of the two 
integers k and k+1 can be even. BUT k and k+1 are consecutive integers so one 
must be even. Since this is a contradition the original premise must be true. 


<b>EXAMPLE 3</b>

Note: to say that x is not divisible by y means that x does not have a
factor of y.

Show that if n is not divisible by 2 or 3 then (n^2)-1 is divisible by 24, 
for all n in {5,6,7,....}.

The numbers we are talking about are:  5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...
Sanity check:  (5^2)-1 = 24. 8 | 24. 

Step 1.
To say that an integer n is not divisible by 2 or 3 means that n is not 
divisible by 2 AND n is not divisible by 3. These are integers not divisible
by 2*3=6. Thus n and can be expressed as follows: 
    6k + 1 
    6k + 2 // skip since this is divisible by 2
    6k + 3 // skip since divisible by 3
    6k + 4 // skip since divisible by 2 
    6k + 5 

We omit 6k + 2, 6k + 3, 6k + 4 since these integers are divisible by 2 or 3.

Assume n is not divisible by 2 or 3. Show that (n^2)-1 has a factor of 24.

Do a <b>proof by cases</b>.

Case 1. n = 6k+1. Show (6k+1)^2 - 1 has a factor of 24.

      (6k+1)^2 - 1
    = 36k^2+12k+1 - 1 
    = 36k^2+12k
    = 12(3k^2 + k)
    = 12(k(3k+1))
    If k is odd then k(3k+1) will be even and have a factor of 2.
    If k is even then k(3k+1) has a factor of 2.
    In either case the expression has a factor of 24.

Case 2. n= 6k+5. Show (6k+5)^2 - 1 has a factor of 24.

     (6k+5)^2 - 1
    =  36k^2+60k+25 - 1
    = 36k^2 + 60k + 24
    = 12(3k^2 +5k + 2)
    = 12(3k+2)(k+1) 
    If k is odd then k + 1 is even and the expression has a factor of 24.
    If k is even then 3k + 2 is even and the expression has a factor of 24.

<b>EXAMPLE 4</b>

Use a <b>proof by contradiction</b> to show that there is no solutions for x and y 
to the equation

     4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 100, for x and y in {1,2,3,...}. 

We do not know what the solution is, but we do know that we want the left-hand
side of the equation to be even. So let's work with that.
 
Re-state the problem in this form as an implication:

    If 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 is an odd number there is no solution to 
    4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 100, for x and y in {1,2,3,...}.

Do a proof by contradiction; i.e., try to show that 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 is odd.

        4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 2(2xy - x + y) - 1.

But 2(2xy - x + y) is even, which means that the entire expression is odd.
If the expression is odd then 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 can't be even. This is a 
contradiction. Thus the original claim must be true. 


<b>EXAMPLE 4</b>

Do an <b>indirect proof</b>. The problem restated as an implication:

"If you pick all possible values of x and y in {1,2,3,...}
                then you will not find a solution to 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 100."

  The problem restated as ~q -> ~p.
 
"If there is some solution to 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 100
                         then x and y will NOT be in {1,2,3,...}."

 Assume there is a solution to 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 100.
                         Show that solution is not in {1,2,3,....}
 
  The solution to (4xy - 2x + 2y - 1) must be even since 100 is even. 
  4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 2(2xy - x + y) - 1. This is the form of an odd integer.
  But there is no odd integer that equals an even integer in {1,2,3,...}. QED.


<b>EXAMPLE 5</b>

Show that the product of two odd integers is an odd integer.

Express in mathematical terms as an inference:
   
     If n and m are odd then n*m is odd.

Use a <b>direct proof</b>. If n and m are odd then n = 2k + 1 and m = 2j + 1.
Then
  nm = (2k + 1)(2j + 1).
     = 4jk + 2k + 2j + 1
     = 2(2jk + k + j) + 1. QED.


<b>EXAMPLE 6</b>

Show that there is a solution to
    4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 = 17, x and y in {1,2,3...}

The LHS is odd and the RHS is odd, so this is not as easy as the previous
problem. But 4xy - 2x + 2y - 1 can be factored into (2x + 1)(2y - 1). 
Since both terms are odd integers, and the product of two odd integers is an 
odd integer (shown above), there could be a solution in integers. So start
trying a few and you see that x=8, y=1 is a solution

       (2*8 + 1)(2*1-1) = 17.


<b>EXAMPLE 7</b>

Prove or disprove: For p > 23, if p is prime then p + 2 is not prime.

Solution: <b>Do an exhaustive proof</b>.
Start writing prime numbers; search past 23 until you find a counterexample
The first counterexample is 29 and 31. 41 and 43 also work.

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73,
79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 
163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241,


<b>EXAMPLE 8</b>

Show that the sum of any two consecutive integers is odd.

Two consecutive integers can be represented as k and k+1. The sum of k + k+1 
is 2k + 1. By the definition of an odd integer, this is odd.


<b>EXAMPLE 9</b>

Show that m mod n = m - nq, q >=0.  
   m mod n = r, where m = nq + r, q >=0, 0 &lt; r &lt; n, and m > n.  
   r = m - nq.
   Thus, 
   m mod n = m - nq, q >=0.  

(By this definition, for m &lt; n, m mod n = m - 0; e.g. 3 mod 4 = 3.)


<b>EXAMPLE 10</b>

Defintions: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. m mod n = m - nq, q >= 0.  
2. m mod n = m, for m &lt; n; e.g. 4 mod 10 = 4.  
3. Two integers m and n are congruent mod x if (m mod x) = (n mod x).
4. m mod n is congruent to 0 mod d if (m mod n) mod d = 0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

"Show that if m and n share a common factor of d then (m mod n) is congruent
 to 0 mod d, m > n and m, n in {1,2,3....}."

By the premise, if m and n share a common factor d then m=dk and n=dj, for 
some integers k,j. Thus, 

  Show (dk mod dj) is congruent to 0 mod d.

By the definition of congruency, (dk mod dj) is congruent to 0 mod d if
  (dk mod dj) mod d = 0
By the definition of mod, 
  dk mod dj = dk - djq, q >= 0 
Substituting this into the original equation:
  (dk - djq) mod d = 0
Factor out d:
  d(k - jq) mod d = 0. qed.

A few more problems using modular arithmetic.

Show that 76 is congruent to 25 mod 3.
(76 mod 3) = (25 mod 3)
         1 = 1, true.

Show that there is a solution for 
   (x^2 + 3x + 3) mod 2 = 1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:
   (x^2 + 3x + 2) mod 2 = 0 
Factor:
   [(x+1)(x+2)] mod 2 = 0 
Note that (x+1) and (x+2) are consecutive integers. Thus (x+1)(x+2) must have
a factor of 2.
