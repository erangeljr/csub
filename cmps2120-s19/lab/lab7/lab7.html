<h2>CMPS-224  Lab 7  Counting with Python</h2>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<b>Goals</b>:
Look at a how programs can process the data held in files and list. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Resources</b>:
 Python 3 Documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Documentation</a><br/>
 Python Lab 7 <a href="./">Materials</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Files Needed</b>: <a href="./USPopulation.txt">USPopulation.txt</a><br/>
The file contains the midyear population of the United States, in thousands, 
during the years 1950 through 1990. The first line in the file contains the 
population for 1950, the second line contains the population for 1951, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that reads a file&rsquo;s contents into a list. The program should then display the following: <br/>
The average annual change in population during the time period.<br/>
The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period.<br/>
The year with the smallest increase in population during the time period.<br/>
    
</p>
<p>
    Code to open a file and read its contents into a list.
</p>
<p>
    <pre class="console">
        # Open the file for reading.
        input_file = open('USPopulation.txt', 'r')
        
        # Read all the lines in the file into a list.
        yearly_population = input_file.readlines()
        
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Pseudocode 
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre class="console">
        Open File
        Read in contents into a list
        Convert each element in list into a numerical data type
        Calculate the change in population size for each two years
        Set initial values for comparisons
        Evaluate the next element 
            Update as necessary
        Calculate Average Chnange by dividing the total change by the number of years
        </pre>
    </p>
<p>
    <pre class="console">
        # Setup variables
        yearly_change = []
        change = 0.0
        total_change = 0.0
        average_change = 0.0
        greatest_increase = 0.0
        smallest_increase = 0.0
        greatest_year = 0
        smallest_year = 0
    
        # Constant for the base year
        BASE_YEAR = 1950        
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Conditions of Satisfactions
</p>
<p>
    <pre class="console">
        The average annual change in population during the time period is 2,443.88
        The year with the greatest increase in population was 1955
        The year with the smallest increase in population was 1967
    </pre>
