 <p> 
 This lab is an introduction to yacc (yet another compiler compiler). Yacc
 is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a 
 grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a 
 C program to parse that grammar. 
 You will be using bison, GNU's implementation of yacc.
 For a gentle introduction to yaac, follow the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lexyac/index.html">IBM Tutorial</a>.
 For more detailed references, refer to the links at the top of this lab.
<p>

 Bison is downwardly compatible with yacc files: all 
 yacc grammars and code will work with Bison.  If you type 'yacc' on
 sleipnir, you are actually running bison. For simplicity, we will
  use the word yacc throughout this course unless the discussion pertains
 to how bison differs from yacc.
  Yacc generates an LALR (Look-Ahead Left-to-right scan Rightmost derivation) 
 parser for a 
 context-free grammar. The default 
 target language for the yacc parser is C (bison also supports C++ and Java).  
  Bison can also produce 
 "Generalized Left-to-right Rightmost" (GLR) parsers for ambiguous grammars.
 We will be generating an LALR parser for all assignments in
 this course.
 <p>
 How Yacc Interfaces with Lex.<br/>
  A yacc parser verifies whether the tokens passed to it from the
 lex scanner pass the syntax rules of the language. For example, this 
 statement <pre>
      if (a == 5) x = 4;</pre>
is a valid C if-statement and would pass the scanner and the parser.
 However, this statement<pre>
      x if (a == 5) 4 =;</pre>
 would pass the scanner but not the parser. 
 Both statements have the same number and type of tokens, but
 the order of the tokens is incorrect. The garbled statement 
 passes the scanner fine but will not pass the syntax rules of the parser.
 This statement <pre>
    7f (a == 5)  x = 4; </pre>
 would not pass either the scanner or the parser.
<p>
 The structure of a  yacc file  is similar to a lex file.
 There are three sections:
<pre>
    declarations
    %%
    rules
    %%
    programs
</pre>
The declarations or programs section may be empty. The smallest yacc file is:
<pre>
    %%
    rules
</pre>
To produce an executable the yacc code section must include the following
  (there are limited versions of these 3 routines in some
  yacc libraries but bison does not include them):
<pre>
     main    // calls yyparse subroutine to start the program
     yyerror // error-handling routine 
     yywrap  // wrap-up subroutine; returns 1 at input file EOF 
</pre>
The lex object file and the yacc object file are linked
 to produce a single
 executable. The main() entry point for the executable must reside in
 the yacc parser. Thus when you interface with yacc put main() in
 your yacc file and do not put a main() in your lex file. 
 <p>
 From main(), things work like this:<pre>
Step 1. main() calls yyparse()
Step 2. yyparse() calls yylex() in a loop until EOF; each call returns a token
Step 3. yylex() returns a valid token or an EOF marker or an error token
Step 4. yyparse() parses the token; if token OK goto Step 2 else goto Step 5. 
Step 5. If recoverable error call yyerror() and repeat from Step 2 else goto 6.
Step 6. at EOF call yywrap() and return 0; if unrecoverable error call yywrap()
        and return 1
</pre>
From the yacc library you have these yacc internal file
 names and definitions. To 
 generate the standard yacc names you must call bison with -y flag.<pre>
   y.tab.c       generated output file
   y.tab.h       header file generated with -d option; 
   yyparse       yacc parsing routine
   yylval        value of current token on the stack - type int by default
   yyerror       yacc error pseudotoken
   yyerrok       procedure to reset parser after error
   yychar        contain lookahead token that caused an error 
   YYSTYPE       defines value type of parsing stack (set by #define)
   %token        defines token preprocessor symbols
   %start        defines the start nonterminal symbol
   %union        defines union YYSTYPE, allowing different types on stack
   %type         defines the variant union type returned by a symbol
   %left         defines left associativity for the list of tokens that follow
   %right        defines right associativity for the list of tokens that follow
   %nonassoc     defines no associativity (either left or right is OK) 

</pre>

<b>LAB INSTRUCTIONS</b><br/>
 Your task is to modify a simple calculator 
 so that it accepts floating point numbers. 
 The current version only accepts integers on input and performs
 integer calculations only; e.g.,
  this input<pre>
     15 / 4
</pre> returns 3. And this input:
 <pre>     2.4 </pre>
returns a parse error.
  To support floating point numbers the value for a float
 number token must be able to handle type float. 
 Integers can always be coerced in C into floats. 
 You do not need to support
  any type checking - just treat everything like a float. 
 C will upcast integers to floating point values.
 When you display your result you will not be able to
 know if input was actually whole number. You lose some
  important information but we will learn to handle this complexity 
 in later weeks. For now, your calculator should behave as
 follows. On this input
<pre> 
(0.5 + 2.5) * 2.1
7.3 * 5 
2 + 2
a = 4
a = a + 6
a / 3  </pre>
your calculator should display this: <pre>
 6.30
36.50
 4.00
10.00
 3.33  </pre>

How to do this? 
Firstly, DO NOT modify the YYSTYPE definition with a preprocessor
 define; e.g.  <pre>
         #define YYSTYPE double !!! DO NOT DO THIS !!! </pre>
 YYSTYPE holds the token number and this should be type int. You will break
 your scanner if you try to mess with YYSTYPE.
 What you need to modify is the yylval for tokens. The default type
 is int. You want this to be a little more flexible so make yylval a union.
 The C union type is similar to a structure, but only ONE of the
 elements is in the union at any given time. The union
 declaration is similar to a struct but designed to save space.
For example, this union
<pre>   union { 
            double fval; 
            int dval;
         }; </pre>
 can hold two different types but only ONE at a time.
 When you declare a variable of type union 
 you get enough memory to hold the largest element, which in this case is
 8 bytes for the double. It is then up to you to know which value
 you wish to use.
 A reference to the union works like this: <pre>
          yylval.fval = 4.5; </pre>
 A floating point value is now stored in the union. 
 The commands to create a union token type and assign tokens to the
 fields in yacc are shown here (as an example):<pre>
     %union { 
        float fval; 
        int dval;
        int digit; 
        char a_z; 
     }
     %token &lt;a_z> LETTER       
     %token &lt;digit> DIGIT 
     %type &lt;fval> expr number 
</pre>
NOTE: you do not need the digit field in your union if you let the lexer
 convert an integer into dval.
<p> 
In Yacc %token assigns a type for yylval for the terminals in the language and
  %type assigns a type for yylval for
  the nonterminals in the language. 
 For details on the use of %union see 
 <a href="./examples/week03/">the sample.l and sample.y code </a> in
 the examples for this
 week. Review these files. When you understand what is going on - implement
 the %union  in calc.
 Before you start modifying code
 you should understand all existing code in the calculator. This
 program demonstrates the interaction between the scanner and the parser.
<P>
 After modifying your lexer to accept 
 floating point numbers in expressions and have a union in place 
 you can call atof to convert yytext into its correct floating
 point value in the lexer.
 Currently the calculator computes the value of an integer
 by having the scanner pass one digit at a time to the parser. The parser
 then computes the decimal value by num = (num * 10) + digit.
 Take this logic out and simply call atoi in the lexer and stuff the result
 into yylval.
<p>
 Copy the files from <a href="./lab03_files/">here</a>
  into your account.<pre>
     $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs450/lab03_files/*  .  </pre>
 Follow the README file to compile and link the calculator.
 If you are rusty in C unions and coercions, review 
 <a href="./examples/week03/coercions.c">coercions.c</a> 
 for C syntax on unions type conversions.
 Start first by modifying calc.l (the source for lex to generate the scanner)
 to accept
 floating point numbers as a valid token type. Right now, this input<pre>
     5.8 + 4 - 7
</pre>returns a scan error when encountering the period. You need to
 define a  regex in your scanner
 to be a string of digits with an optional period followed by another
 string of digits; e.g., these are all acceptable numbers
(you don't need to support scientific notation or octal numbers unless you 
 wish to): <pre>
     1.3  3.0  44 </pre>
<p>
<b>Error Handling</b><br/>
 Your final task is to understand the
 error handling facilities in your yacc-generated parser. Yacc treats
 errors as a form of productions. You decide what nonterminals
 in your language to associate with error recovery.
 A production of the form 
          <pre> A -> error &alpha; </pre>
where A is a major nonterminal, &alpha; is a string 
     of grammar symbols or &epsilon;, and error is a yacc reserved word.
<p>
  When the yacc parser encounters an error, it pops symbols from
 the parsing stack until it hits a state on the top of the stack 
  in which an error production is included in the set of items.
  The parser shifts a pseudo-token error onto the stack. 
 <p>
 When &alpha; is &epsilon;, a reduction to A occurs immediately and
 the parser fires the semantic action for A -> error.
 <p>
 When &alpha; is not &epsilon;, the parser skips ahead on input for
 a substring that can be reduced to &alpha;. If &alpha; is all terminals,
 then the parser looks for these terminals and reduces them by shifting
 them onto the stack.  
 <p>
The parser reduces error &alpha; to A and resumes normal parsing.
(This is accomplished by calling the 
 special yacc routine yyerrok, which resets the parser to its normal 
 mode of operation.)
 <p>
  If while evaluating a sequence of expressions
  your calculator encounters a syntax error, the parser 
 starts popping symbols from its stack until it  hits the token error.
  Next, the parser shifts an error token onto the stack and skips past 
 input until hitting the newline. The parser then shifts newline onto
 the stack, reduces error token and displays the default error
  message "Error".
 The yyerrok; routine is then called to reset the parser.
  Your task is to modify the error handler yyerror() to display 
 the lineno at which the error occurs.
