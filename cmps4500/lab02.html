<p>
 You may notice similarities
 between lex and awk. Aho (co-author of the Dragon book)
 wrote awk. Lex is based in large part on awk. (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9091419/The_A_Z_of_programming_languages_awk">interview with Aho</a>). Lex was designed to interface with Yacc ( the
  use of 'yy' in filenames comes from this relationship ).
	<p>
	You need to know C to use flex and yacc. 
	See above links for sample C code and C documentation. 
	<p>
The <a href="./examples/week02/README">Lex getting started guide</a> 
and the <a href="./examples/week02/">examples for week 02</a>
 should be sufficient to get you started. Review the 
 <a href="./examples/week02/flex-manpage">flex manpage</a>
 and documentation from the
 <a href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/">Lex & Yacc page</a> to help
 you understand these simple lex programs.
  Copy or wget my examples files into your directory:<pre>
      $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs450/examples/week02/* .
      $ make
 </pre>
  Read the source, compile and execute
  each of the example programs. When you are comfortable with each of
   these small programs,  start on the following.
   <p>
  <h3>Modifying Your First Lexical Scanner</h3>

  You job is to add some additional features to this
   <a href="./lab02_files/lab02.l">lab02.l scanner</a>.
	 Copy or wget these files into your lab02 directory: 
<pre>    $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs450/lab02_files/* .  </pre>
   Test with the following:<pre>
     $ flex lab02.l
     $ gcc -o lab02 lex.yy.c -lfl
     $ cat test.cf | ./lab02 </pre>
If everything is working properly, the flex scanner you just created
      will read this file  
   <pre>
   { a sample program }
   read x;
   if 34 < x then
   result := result * 7;
   repeat
     result := result * x;
   until x = 0;
   write result
   end </pre>
       and display <a href="./lab02_files/outfile">this</a>
       on the screen.
       <p>
<b>Task #1.</b> One problem with the original scanner is that it
 has a wierd syntax for comments. Modify your scanner so that
 instead of stripping out comments that look like this
     <pre> { this is a comment } </pre>
 you strip out one line C-style comments:
     <pre> /* this is a C-style comment */ </pre> 
 See <a href="./examples/week02/comments.l">comments.l</a> for
 some suggestions on how to do this. For Phase I you will strip
 out multi-line comments. One line is sufficient for this lab.
  To test your scanner, replace the comment in test.cf with a C-style comment.
		  <p>

<b>Task #2.</b> Another problem with the scanner is that it 
 does not classify the lexemes into their token types.
 Currently it displays a 3-tuple &lt;lexeme, line, token_num>.
  Modify the scanner to classify each 
 token that it encounters into one of the following types:
  <pre>
    Identifier
    Keyword
    Number
    Operator
    Punctuator </pre>
 For each token, display the text of the token, the token type and the line  
 number.  Eventually you will construct a 
symbol table to hold some of this
 information, but for now spit it out any way you like.
  Display token information as one token per line - it is easier to read. 
 At the end of output, display the  total token count.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Task #3.</b> Modify the scanner to accept as a number token 
  a C floating point constant, defined as  <p>

 "an integer part, a decimal point, a 
 fraction part, an [eE], and an optionally signed  integer exponent. 
 The integer and fraction parts both consist of a sequence of digits. 
 Either the integer part or the fraction part (but not both) can be missing. 
 Either the decimal point or the [eE] and the exponent (not both) can 
  be missing. " (C reference manual Ch. 3)
 
 <p>
Note: this definition allows <pre>
       7e3
       7.e3
       752.  
       .05e-5
       73.87 
       .5
       5.</pre>
but does not allow <pre>
       75
       .
       752e </pre>
Hint: The easiest way to do this may be to use three
 regexes for your float: {integer}, {fraction}, {exponent}.
 You do not have to catch everything for the lab but you
 will for phaseI of the project.
 For now, test your scanner
 against floating points numbers such as
 34.3e-3 and .5 (from test2.cf). 
    
<p> 
 <b>Task #4.</b> Modify the scanner to accept as an operator token the 
  two C shorthand assignment operators: += and -=.
 </p>

 Run your new and improved scanner against <a href="./lab02_files/test2.cf">test2.cf</a> from the lab02_files directory.
 See <a href="./lab02_files/out">sample output</a>.
