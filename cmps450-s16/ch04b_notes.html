<tt> <p>
 Syntax analysis occurs during parsing. The parser's job is to
 determine whether an input stream of terminal tokens
  meets the specifications of the context free grammar defined by the parser.
 Parsing can occur top-down or bottom-up. In top-down parsing the root of 
 parse tree (the
 starting symbol of the grammar) is constructed first. In bottom-up parsing 
  the leaf nodes of the parse tree (the terminals)
 are constructed first. An unambiguous grammar will produce the same 
 parse tree during bottom-up and top-down parsing although the nodes on
 the tree will be added in a different order.
Both forms of parsing use a left-to-right scan of the input stream.
  The context-sensitive components of a programming language (also
 called static semantics or attribute grammars)
 are covered in the next chapter.
 </p>

<h4> Ch.4.4 "Top-Down Parsing"</h4>

<p>
  In top-down parsing the leftmost nonterminal of a production rule
 in the language is always evaluated first.
  This technique corresponds to a leftmost derivation.
  When you construct a parse tree starting from the root as the
 starting symbol and follow a leftmost derivation
  you are essentially performing top-down parsing.
  There are two types of top-down parsing algorithms:
</p>
  <p>
  #1. recursive descent parsing (the syntax analyzer is 
  based directly on the recursive rules in the BNF grammar describing 
  the language) 
  The implementation is a series of recursive calls mirroring the BNF rules.
  Recursive descent can involve
  backtracking if you pick the wrong rule.
</p>
<p>
  #2. LL(k) parsing algorithms (the 
  first 'el' means left-to-right scan and the second 'el' 
   means leftmost derivation and the 'k' is the number of lookahead
   symbols). The lookahead symbol is the next token in the input
 string. 
	 LL(k) grammars define languages to which LL(k) parsing  can be applied. 
   The letter 'k'  denotes the number of lookahead symbols needed to
   prevent backtracking.
</p>
<p>
  Predictive parsing refers to the behavior of LL(k) parsers in
 in which the 
   lookahead symbol unambiguously determines the flow from LHS (head)
 to RHS (body) of 
   the BNF rules.  Without predictive parsing, top-down algorithm may involve 
   backtracing if the incorrect rule is selected.
   An LL(1) parser is a predictive parser that
   uses one (1) input symbol of 
   lookahead at each step to make parsing decisions. 
<p>
 The big drawback to LL parsing is that left recursive rules 
   must be removed. Left recursive rules result in infinite recursion.  
   
<h4> RECURSIVE DESCENT</h4>
<pre>Grammar G. &Sigma; = {+, -, *,(,)} 
      exp &rarr; exp addop term | term
      addop &rarr; + | -
      term &rarr; term mulop factor | factor
      mulop &rarr; *
      factor &rarr; (exp) | NUM</pre>

  As an example, BNF rule term -> factor can be implemented  with one symbol (token) of lookahead:
<div style="border: 1px solid black; width:80%;">
<pre>
    //  holds next token in input
    TokenType token;     

    procedure factor  {
      case token of
       (: match ( '(' );
          exp();
          match( ')' ); 
       number:
          match (NUM);
       else
          error;
    }

 // match current token with expectedToken
 // advance input if OK else return err 
  match ( TokenType expectedToken ) {
    if token == expectedToken 
       then getToken;
    else 
       err;
  }         </pre> </div>
<p>
 To avoid infinite recursion you need to eliminate left recursion or
 replace BNF rule 
 <pre>         exp &rarr; exp addop term | term  </pre>
  with an extended BNF (EBNF) rule: 
  <pre>      exp &rarr; term { addop term } </pre>
 where the curly braces expresses repetition of zero or more times.
  You can then safely use the EBNF rule in a top-down parser.
</p>
<h4>  Top-Down LL(1) PARSING</h4>


 Recursive descent works because the runtime stack handles the
 BNF recursive definitions.
 An alternative to recursive calls is to use a parsing table and
 an explicit stack to implement the BNF rules
   rather than relying on the runtime stack provided through
  recursive calls.
  LL(1) parsing is a top-down methodology that uses an explicit stack
 to handle the recursive BNF rules.
 
<pre>EXAMPLE.
             S &rarr; (S)S | e      // language of balanced parentheses </pre>
<p>
  Overview. Initially, the input buffer
 holds the string to be parsed, ending with $:<pre>
          () $ </pre>
 The stack starts with symbol '$' to denote the bottom of the stack. 
 The starting rule is 'S' so push S onto the stack. Read input. 
 On hitting '(' S evaluates to (S)S. Pop 'S'
 and push (S)S onto the stack in reverse order. Why reverse? Because you
 want the leftmost terminal symbol at the top of the stack as you read
 input.
  When you hit a 
  match you pop and advance input. If the top of the stack is a nonterminal
 and has an epsilon rule, follow the epsilon rule and pop the nonterminal
  but don't advance input. Continue process until EOF or error.</p> 
<pre> input: ()$

              (         
              S  S                
              )  )  )      
           S  S  S  S  S  
stack:     $  $  $  $  $ $
          -------------------
input:        (  )       $     Accept!
           1  2  3  4  5 6 </pre>

<p>
 The above process is also shown below, where '$' denotes 
 the stack bottom and EOF, and process begins by pushing
 the starting symbol onto the stack. Terminals are popped off
 the stack when the terminal matches input. Nonterminals
 are popped off the stack by the epsilon rule. This rule is
 triggered when the other rule that matches input.  </p>
<pre>
       Parsing Stack   Input   Action
     1 $S              ()$     S &rarr; (S)S   <=pop S and push S)S( 
     2 $S)S(           ()$     match
     3 $S)S             )$     S&rarr;e
     4 $S)              )$     match
     5 $S                $     S&rarr;e
     6 $                 $     accept </pre>
<p>
  LL(1) Parsing Table.<br>

  Assume nonterminal A is at the top of the parsing stack. Upon receiving
 input a decision needs to be made about what rule to place on the stack.
  When a token (i.e., a terminal) is at the top of the stack, 
 no decision is needed. The choices are loaded
 into a LL(1) parsing table, where M[N,T] is read as the Move on non-terminal
  N for the token T.</p><pre>
   ----------+-----------+--------+---------
    M[N,T]   |   (       |   )    |     EOF 
    ---------+-----------+--------+---------
     S       | S &rarr; (S)S  |  S &rarr; e |  S &rarr; &epsilon; 
    ----------------------------------------</pre>
 <p>
 The parsing table describes all actions that can be taken
as parsing progresses.<p>
 Another example.
Terminals '(' and ')' normally surrounding a boolean statement are omitted 
 since there is no action associated with them. Notation: 'e' is epsilon.
<pre><tt>        <i>stmt</i> &rarr; <i>if-stmt</i>  | <i>other</i>

        <i>else-stmt</i> &rarr; <b>else</b> <i>stmt</i> | &epsilon;
        <i>bool</i> &rarr; <b>0</b> | <b>1 </b></pre>
Table 1. LL(1) parsing table constructed from the above grammar 
<p>

 The two entries in M[<i>else-stmt</i>,<b>else</b>] correspond to the dangling else ambiguity.

 Grammars that are not as simple as the ones above
  require the computation of lookahead sets called FIRST and FOLLOW in
 order to construct the parsing table.
<p>
The elements in FIRST and FOLLOW are terminals in the language.

<u>Definitions.</u> <br>

A sentential form is any valid RHS 
 in a derivation of some input string. Sentential forms
 can contain terminals or nonterminals. The last sentential
 form is all terminals since it is the input string itself.
For example, given grammar
<pre>        S -> 0Q 
        Q -> S1 | 1 </pre>
over the set of binary strings, a leftmost derivation of 0011 is this: <pre>
          S -> 0Q
            -> 0S1   // applying Q -> S1 produces sentential form 0S1
            -> 00Q1  // applying S -> 0Q produces sentential form 00Q1
            -> 0011  // applying Q -> 1  produces sentential form 0011 </pre> 
 
**************
* FIRST SETS *      
**************

Notation: *-> means 1 or more derivations.

 FIRST(X), where X is a single grammar symbol (nonterminal
 or terminal), is  defined as the set
 of terminals that begin strings derived in one or more derivations from X.
<p/>
<div style="background-color:white; 
  width:800px; border:1px solid black; padding:3px 10px;margin: 5px;">
 FIRST(X), for terminal or nonterminal X, is computed as follows: <p>
 RULE 1. If X is a terminal then FIRST(X) = {X}.                                <p/> 
RULE 2. If X is a nonterminal and X->Y_1 Y_2...Y_k is a production
 for some k>=1, then place <b>a</b> in FIRST(S) if for some i,
 <b>a</b> is in FIRST(Y_i) and &epsilon; is in all
 of FIRST(Y_1),...,FIRST(Y_i-1).
 If &epsilon; is in FIRST(Y_j) for all j = 1,2,...,k, then add &epsilon;                 to FIRST(X). If Y_1 does not derive &epsilon;, then add nothing 
 more to FIRST(X), but if Y_1 *-> &epsilon;, then add FIRST(Y_2) and so on.
<p/>
RULE 3. If X->&epsilon; is a production, then add &epsilon; to FIRST(X).
<p/>
</div>


 <p> 
     FIRST(&alpha;), &alpha; = X_1 X_2 . . . X_n, can now be defined as:
<p/>
 FIRST(&alpha;) contains FIRST(X_1) - {e}. For each i = 2,...,n, if
 FIRST(X_k) contains &epsilon; for all k=1,...,i-1, then FIRST(q) contains
 FIRST(X_i) - {e}. Finally, if for all i = 1,..,n, FIRST(X_i) contains
 &epsilon; then FIRST(q) contains &epsilon;.
     <p>
 The definition for FIRST can be implemented by an iterative algorithm
 (simplified here by avoiding &epsilon;-productions). 
<div><pre>
     // computing FIRST(A), assuming no &epsilon;-productions  
     for all nonterminals A do FIRST(A) = {};
     while there are changes to any FIRST(A) do
          for each production choice A &rarr; X_1,X_2,..X_n do
             add FIRST(X_1) to FIRST(A);
</pre></div>
 
 
<hr>
An important attribute of a nonterminal is whether it is NULLABLE.
<p>
<u>Definition</u>. A nonterminal X is nullable if X *-> &epsilon;. 

<pre>*****************
*  FOLLOW SETS *
*****************
</pre>

<u>Definition</u>.<br>

 FOLLOW(A), for nonterminal A, is the set of terminals 
  a that can appear immediately to the right of A in some
 sentential form; 
  i.e., the set of terminals a
  for which there exists a derivation <font size=+1>
<pre>    
  S *-> &alpha;Aa&beta;, for some &alpha; and &beta;   
</font></pre>
Example.<div><pre>
              S
           / / \ \ 
          &alpha; A   d &beta; 
           / \
          c   &gamma;

Terminal c is in FIRST(A) and Terminal d is in FOLLOW(A).
</pre></div>
<p>

<div style="background-color:white; width:600px; border:1px solid black; padding:3px 10px;margin: 5px;">
FOLLOW(A), for all nonterminals A,  is computed 
 recursively by these rules: <p>
 
Rule 1. Place $ in FOLLOW(S), where S is the start symbol, and $
is the input right endmarker.<p>

Rule 2. If there is a production A &rarr; &alpha;B&beta;, then everything in
 FIRST(&beta;) except &epsilon; is in FOLLOW(B).

<p/>Rule 3. If there is a production A &rarr; &alpha;B, or a production
 A &rarr; &alpha;B&beta;, where FIRST(&beta;) contains &epsilon;, then 
 everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B).
</div>
<p>
In general, FIRST is constructed by looking at the LHS of a production and
 determining which terminal(s) that are derived first. FOLLOW is constructed by
 looking at nonterminals in the RHS of productions and determining which
 terminal(s) follow it first.
<pre><tt>
Example from Dragon. 
E -> TE'
E' -> +TE' | e
T -> FT'
T' -> *FT' | e
F-> (E) | id

FIRST(E) = {(,id}
FIRST(E')= {+,e}
FIRST(T) = {(,id}
FIRST(T')= {*,e}
FIRST(F) = {(,id}

FOLLOW(E) = {$,)}      // EOF symbol is in follow E
FOLLOW(E')= {$,)}      // since E' appears only at the end of E productions
FOLLOW(T) = {+,),$}    // first(E') - e and follow(E)
FOLLOW(T')= {+,),$}    // T' appears only at ends of T production so follow(T)
FOLLOW(F) = {+,*,),$}  // first(T') - e; follow(E); first(E') - e 

EXAMPLE TWO. 
Grammar G = &lt;S,&Sigma;,N,P>      
  &Sigma; = {+, -, *, (, ), NUM}   // terminals
  S = exp    // the starting symbol
  N = {exp, addop, term, mulop, factor} // nonterminals 
  P, the set the set of productions in  G:
   
     exp &rarr; exp addop term | term
     addop &rarr; + | -
     term &rarr; term mulop factor | factor
     mulop &rarr; *
     factor &rarr; (exp) | NUM 
</pre> </div>
The FIRST and FOLLOW sets contain terminals from &Sigma;. Both sets are 
recursively constructed in multiple passes through the grammar rules. When 
complete, every symbol in G has a FIRST set. Every nonterminal symbol in G 
has a FOLLOW set.  Since |&Sigma;| = 6 and |N| = 5, there are 11 FIRST sets 
and 5 FOLLOW sets.  FIRST and FOLLOW sets for G: <p>

<div><pre>
   FIRST(exp)    = {(, NUM}        FIRST(() = {(}    
   FIRST(term)   = {(, NUM}        FIRST()) = {)}
   FIRST(factor) = {(, NUM}        FIRST(+) = {+}
   FIRST(addop)  = {+, -}          FIRST(-) = {-}
   FIRST(mulop)  = {*}             FIRST(*) = {*}
                                   FIRST(NUM) = NUM
   
   FOLLOW(exp)    = {$,+,-,)}
   FOLLOW(addop)  = {(,NUM}
   FOLLOW(term)   = {$,+,-,*,) } 
   FOLLOW(mulop)  = {(,NUM} 
   FOLLOW(factor) = {$,+,-,*,)}
   </pre> </div>

  A grammar G is LL(1) if and only if whenever A &rarr; &alpha; | &beta;,
  FIRST(&alpha;) and FIRST(&beta;) are disjoint sets. If
 &epsilon; is in FIRST(&beta;) then FIRST(&alpha;) and
 FOLLOW(A) are disjoint sets. <p>

 Is Grammar G from Example 2 LL(1)?<Br/>
 FIRST(exp) &cap; FIRST(term) = {(,NUM}. Not LL(1). The next
 section discusses bottom-up parsing, which is a technique by which
 languages that are not LL(1) can be parsed.

<h3> Ch 4.5 Bottom-Up Parsing</h4>
<p>	
   LR grammars define languages to which LR parsing   can
	 be applied. LR meaning a left-to-right scan, a rightmost 
    derivation and a bottom-up recursive <i>ascent</i>. Left recursion 
   is not a problem in LR grammars. The primary drawback is that LR parsers 
   are difficult
   to code manually, thus are usually generated by a parser generator. 
   Yacc generates an LALR parser (Look-Ahead LR parser) which is a simplified
   version of a canonical LR parser.
</p>
<p>
Bottom-up parsing is a process of "reducing" a string  back to the
 starting symbol of the grammar.  Decisions involve when to reduce and
 what production rule to apply. Going "backwards" means
 you need to know what chunk of symbols is
 is the body of a production in G. 
 These 'chunks' are called handles. This is the same Grammar G as
 above, simplified slightly to make parsing easier to read. 
 &Sigma; = {+,*,(,),id}. N = {E,T,F}. S = E. There are six 
 production rules. The handles for G are 
  the RHS of each rule in G.
<p>
<div><pre>
      --------------

Rule 1.   E -> E + T       E+T     
Rule 2.   E -> T           T
Rule 3.   T -> T * F       T*F   
Rule 4.   T -> F           F
Rule 5.   F -> (E)         (E)   
Rule 6.   F -> id          id
 
Example 1.
Input string: id + id 

Rightmost derivation (F derives to id in E+F):
------------------------------------------------------------
  E => E + T => E + <span>F</span> => T + <span>id</span> => F + id => id+id


Example 2.
Input string: id * id 

Rightmost derivation (F derives to id in T*F):
------------------------------------------------------------
  E => T => T * <span>F</span> => T * <span>id</span> => F * id => id*id</pre>


<p>
   Bottom-up parsing is a rightmost derivation in reverse. When you have a
   choice of handles (as in id * id) select the leftmost handle since we
   are doing a left-to-right scan. Bottom-up parse on input string:
   id * id:
<pre>
   --        --           --    -----       --
   id * id   F * id   T * id    T * F        T           E
             |        |         |   |      / | \         |
             id       F         F   id    T  *  F        T
                      |         |         |     |      / | \
                      id        id        F     id    T  *  F
                                          |           |     |
                                          id          F     id
                                                      |
                                                      id
</pre></div>  <p>
<u>Handle Pruning</u> is the process of grabbing the handle and
 reducing it (deriving in reverse) to the LHS (head) of its 
 sentential form. Handles are marked by as dashed line in
 the parse tree  above.
 Handle pruning produces a right-most derivation in reverse.
</p>
<p>

<u>Shift-Reduce Parsing</u> is an implementation of bottom-up parsing in 
 which a stack holds the grammar symbols and an input buffer holds the
 string to be parsed. This uses the same data structures (a stack and a
 buffer) as in
  the top-down parsing with a stack but the technique differs. 
 The stack begins empty.
 "Shift" means to
 move a terminal symbol from input onto the stack. Reduce means to
 reduce the current sentential form on the stack to another sentential
 form. "Accept" occurs when the stack holds the start symbol
  and the buffer is
 empty($). "Error" occurs when the shift/reduce process gets stuck
 before the Accept state. Using
 Grammar G and the input string: x * y, 
 the actions of shift-reduce are shown below. Note that the handle
 always appears at the top of the stack.
