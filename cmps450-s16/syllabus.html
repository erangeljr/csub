<b>Course Goals/Objectives:</b><br> 
 Compilers is one area in computer science in which theory and practice
 go hand and hand. Thus, this course will be 50% theory and 50% practice.
 The theoretical models covered include automata, grammars, regular expressions,
 and trees. Practice will include using several compiler tools as well
  as programming a compiler that implements
  the theory.
