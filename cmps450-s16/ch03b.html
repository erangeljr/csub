<h4>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS & FINITE-STATE AUTOMATA  </h4> 

The process by which a scanner recognizes valid sentences in a regular language
is formalized by the theory of finite-state automata. The 
word <i>automata</i> is from the Greek word for "self-acting." (Automata is
 plural, automaton is singular.)
<p>

 Notation: By default JFLAP uses &lambda; (lambda)
 to denote the empty string. The text uses &epsilon;. 
 JFLAP also uses '+' to denote '|' the OR operator. 
 <p> 
 Progressing through a transition diagram from state to state is theoretically
 described by finite-state automata (FA). An FA returns "Yes" if the string is 
 in the language and "No" otherwise. Like transition diagrams, FAs have edges 
 and states. The complete description for finite automata is shown below.

<pre><tt>
 A Finite Automaton M is a 5-tuple &lt;S, A, s0, F, t> where 
  	S = finite set of states
  	A = finite set of input alphabet (the terminal alphabet)
  	s0= start state
  	F = set of final states, where F is a subset of S
  	t = transition function </tt></pre>

<h4>  DFAs and NFAs </h4> 

 Deterministic Finite-
  state Automata (DFAs) and Non-deterministic Finite-state Automata (NFAs)
 differ by mapping function.
  DFAs do not allow multiple edges leaving a particular state to have the same 
  label and do not allow &lambda; as an edge label. NFAs have no restriction on
  edge labels and allow &lambda; as a possible transition label. 
 Since &lambda; is the 
  empty string, a transition can be made from one state to another on no input. 
  Automata that accept &lambda;-transitions and multiple edges with the 
 same input 
  are non-deterministic (NFA); 
 i.e., you cannot predict the exact path an automaton 
  might take by looking at the transition function. Automata 
 without &lambda;-transitions 
  or multiple edges with the same input are deterministic (DFA). 
 <p>
  The transition function for a DFA returns, for each state in S and each 
  symbol in A, a single next state.

   <pre> t = S x A -> S  // DFA transition function returns single state</pre>

  The transition function t for an NFA returns, for each state in S and each 
  symbol in A including &lambda;, a set of next states from S.

<pre>   t = S x {A U &lambda;} -> {f | f &isin; S}  // NFA transition function
                                         // returns s set of states </pre>

  A string is accepted by DFA M if the set of states returned by t* contains at
  least one accepting state. 
 <p> 
  If no transition is specified for a (state, symbol) pair then the FA is 
  incompletely specified. The &Oslash; (null) state entered in the table
  in this case. A string is rejected if it reaches a state where 
  there is no transition for the next symbol. 
<p>
  L(M) is the language accepted by automaton M.
<pre>
*----------------------------------------------*
|  Example of a DFA: Newspaper Vending Machine |
*----------------------------------------------*

  The control device for a newspaper vending machine keeps track of the amount 
  of money (nickels, dimes, quarters) entered, and opens the door only if the 
  amount is at least 25 cents.
  
  The amount entered is the state of the machine. We move to a new state if 
  another coin is entered by following a transition function. 
  
  Transition table t for newspaper vending machine:
  
  	  | n   d   q
  	--+-----------
  	 0| 5   10  25
  	 5| 10  15  25
  	10| 15  20  25
  	15| 20  25  25
  	20| 25  25  25
  	25| 25  25  25

  If we are in state 10 and a nickel is entered, we transition to state 15. 
  
  If a quarter is entered from state 10, we move to state 25. In shorthand 
  string notation, ndq denotes entering a nickel, a dime, and a quarter in 
  that order. This automaton accepts all input strings that end up in the
  final state 25. For example, we accept dnd but reject the string dnn.
  
  This automaton M is defined as
  	A = { n, d, q } 
  	S = { 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 }  
  	s0= 0 
  	F = { 25 } 
  	t = S x A -> S    // defined by the above transition table
 
  A sequence of states is called a path: 0, 5, 25 

  The language defined (or accepted) by automaton M, denoted by L(M), is the 
  set of all strings that label some path from s0 to a final state in F.

      L(M) =  {  q, nq, dq, ndd, ddn, dnd, .... }

  ,-----------------------,
  | A FORMALISM FOR L(M)  |
  '-----------------------'

  We can recursively describe L(M) with a function.

  Let function t* be an extension of function t in order to accept all possible
  input strings rather than a single character:

       t* : S x A* -> Q  (Given a state and a string, outputs a new state)
 
  A* is the Kleene-closure of the terminal alphabet A. Then t* fully describes 
  L(M):

      L(M) = { w : t*(0,w) &isin; F }

  A definition for t*(q,w). 
  If w == &lambda; then t* = q
  If w is a single character then t*(q, w) = t(q,w)
  If w is a string then let w = va, where a is the last character, v is 
  everything before it. Then t* is recursively defined as:

        t* (q, w) = d* (q, va) =  d(d*(q,v),a) 
  
   // t* algorithm in C 
   state tstar( state q, string v)
   {
      if ( v == &lambda;)
        return q;
  
      char a = lastsymbol(string);     // returns the last symbol in a string
      string u = allbutlastsymbol(v);  // does just what you think it does 
      state r = tstar(q,u);            // r is the state u takes us to
      return( t(r,a));                 // the transition from QxA -> Q
   }
  
  TSTAR EXAMPLE
        |a b       { The states are 0 and 1. The input symbols are a and b. }
      --+---         F = { 1 }. 
      0 |0 1
      1 |0 1 
  
  Notation: [current state, remaining string]
  
      [0,aba] -> [0,ba] -> [1,a] -> [0, &lambda;]

  aba is not accepted since input is exhausted and we are not in a final state.
  
          L(M) = {w in A* | w ends in b}

  Note: The number of states in a path is |w| + 1. Thus, if the length of the 
  string is at least the number of states, a state must be repeated i.e. the 
  path must have a loop.
  
  EXAMPLE
        |a b      F = { 3 }
      --+---
      0 |2 1
      1 |1 1     Note that state 1 is a trap state.
      2 |3 2 
      3 |3 2 
  
  L(M) = a ( a | b )* a, the set of all strings that start and end with a.         
  Computation for aaba:
  [0,aaba] -> [2, aba] -> [3,ba] -> [2,a] -> [3,&lambda;] accepted
  
  EXAMPLE
        |a b      F = { 2 }
      --+---
      0 |0 1
      1 |0 2   
      2 |2 2 
  
  L(M) = the set of all strings that contain the substring bb. The RE is: 
  
        (a|b)*bb(a|b)*         
 
  ,-----------------,
  | L(M) COMPLEMENT |
  '-----------------'

  We can construct an FA for the complement language L' by simply interchanging 
  accepting and non-accepting states. If we change F to F = {0,1}, the language
  is the set of all strings which do not contain bb.
  
  This method works in general. We can always transform an FA for a language L 
  into an FA for L'.  </tt></pre>

<h3> Ch.3.7 "Regular Expressions and Finite Automata"</h3>

The abstract machine that accepts or rejects an input string is modeled on 
 automata, thus we now consider how to convert an RE into an automaton.
  Drawing the transition diagram based on the RE is relatively easy 
 in simple cases. The RE below is easily represented by a DFA.
<pre>      a*ba*b  </pre>
<img src="./material/dfa-1.png" height="200px;" width="350px;">
</pre><br/>
 Slightly more complex REs are difficult to depict with DFAs but
 fairly easy to  depict by NFAs. For example, this regex
 <pre> (a|b)*abb </pre>
 is easily described by this NFA:
<br/>
<img src="./Images/dragon1.png" align="top"><br/>
 The Transition Table for (a|b)*abb is shown below.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr> <td><b>State</b></td>
<td><b>a</b></td>
<td><b>b</b></td>
<td><b>&epsilon;</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>q0</td><td>{q0,q1}</td><td>{q0}</td><td>&Oslash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>q1</td><td>&Oslash;</td><td>{q2}</td><td>&Oslash;
</td></tr>
<tr><td>q2</td><td>&Oslash;</td><td>{q3}</td><td>&Oslash;
</td></tr>
</table> Accepting State = q3
<p>
 The problem with the above NFA is that when the scanner encounters
 an 'a' from q0 does it stay in q0 or move to q1? Such non-determinism
 works for humans but not for computer algorithms. Machine 
 implementation must ultimately
 be deterministic.  The question is how to convert a DFA into
 an NFA. It turns out that
 all NFAs can be converted into equivalent  DFAs and, importantly,
 with roughly the same number of states.

<h4>Subset Construction Algorithm for NFA to DFA </h4>

 Let N be a DFA.
 The algorithm requires these operations, where 'e' denotes &epsilon;
 (the empty string), s 
 is a single state in N and T is a set of states in N: 
<pre>
  OPERATION     DESCRIPTION
  e-closure(s)  Set of NFA states reachable from NFA state s on e-transitions 
                alone

  e-closure(T)  Set of NFA states reachable from some NFA state s in set T 
                on e-transitions alone; this is the union of all e-closure(s) 
                operations

  move(T,a)     Set of NFA states to which there is a transition on input
                symbol 'a' from some state s in T.  </pre>

<h4>The On-the-fly Subset Construction Algorithm for Simulating an NFA </h4>

The On-the-fly algorithm constructs the NFA by applying subset
 construction to the DFA dynamically.


<h4>The McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson Algorithm to Convert RE to NFA </h4>

This is Algorithm 3.23 in the text.<pre>
Input: regex r over alphabet Sigma (&Sigma;)
Output: NFA N accepting L(r), with new start state i and new final state [f].
</pre>

Method: Parse r into subexpressions. Apply conversion rules to each
 subtree of the parse tree. Then construct 
larger NFAs by combining the NFAs of all the subtrees.
<p>
The validity of this approach is shown with structural induction using 
the atomic rules (Rule 1 and Rule 2) as a basis.
<pre>
Notation: Let s,t be regexes; then s0, t0 are the respective start states 
and [s] and [t] are the respective accepting (final) states.

N(r) is the NFA accepting r; N(r) is defined by a transition table.

                                  &lambda;
RULE 1.  if r = &lambda; then N(r) =  i [f]     
                                                            a 
RULE 2. if r = some terminal symbol 'a' in &Sigma; then N(r) = i [f] 

RULE 3. Union Operator. If r = s|t, then N(r) accepts either L(s) or L(t). Use
&lambda; transitions to combine N(s) and N(t). Then N(s|t) is defined by all 
transitions for N(s) and N(t) combined by the following transitions: 

                 &lambda;
            i   {s0,t0}
           [s]  [f]
           [t]  [f]

RULE 3. Concatenation Operator. If r = st, then N(r) accepts input accepted
by N(t) followed by input accepted by N(s). This is accomplished by assigning 
i = s0, [f] = [t] and by merging all accepting states for N(s) with the
start states of N(t). Concatentation does not require any new transitions.

RULE 4. * (Kleene closure) Operator. If r = s* then N(r) consists of new states
i and [f], one &lambda; transition from i to [f], two &lambda; transitions from i to s0 and 
[s] to [f] to bracket N(s), and one &lambda; transition from [s] back to s0. The four 
new transitions added to N(s) are: <pre>

                     &lambda;
               [i]  [f]    // transition for s^0 
                i   s0     // this transition ensures a single start state 
               [s]  [f]    // this transition ensures a single final state
               [s]  s0

Note: the goal is to create an NFA with a single start and a single final state.

RULE 5. Parentheses Operator. If r = (s) then L(r) = L(s), thus N(s) = N(r).

,---------------------,
| Example. (a|b)*abb  |
'---------------------'

Step 1. Construct the expression tree.

                            r_11
                           /    \
                         r_9     r_10
                       /    \      |
                     r_7    r_8    b      
                    /  \     |
                  r_5   r_6  b
                 /  \    |
                r_4  *   a
              /  /  \
            (   r_3  )
               / \ \
            r_1  |  r_2
             |       |
             a       b

Step 2. Apply rules to regexes starting with tree leaves (atomic rules). The 
NFA will be constructed in a depth-first left to right traversal or the 
expression tree. The first partial NFA constructed is for r_1 and the last 
is r_11. Summary:

   For regex:     Apply:
   r_1  a         Rule 1. construct NFA for terminal a
   r_2  b         Rule 1. construct NFA for terminal b
   r_3 a | b      Rule 3. combine r_1 and r_2 and assign new start state i
   r_4 (r_3)      Rule 5. since r_4 = r_3 skip
   r_5 (a | b)*   Rule 4. &lambda; everywhere and assign new start and end state
   r_6  a         Rule 1. construct NFA for 'a' (can't reuse NFA from r_1)
   r_7 (a | b)*a  Rule 3. merge tail of r_5 NFA with head of r_6 NFA
   r_8 b          Rule 1. construct new NFA for terminal b
   r_9 (a|b)*ab   Rule 4. merge tail of r_7 with head of r_8           
   r_10 b         Rule 1. new NFA for terminal b
   r_11 (a|b)*aab Rule 3. merge tail of r_9 with head of r_10   </pre>
</pre>
The start state for the NFA comes from r_5, the final state from r_10.
The transaction diagram for the NFA constructed from (a|b)*abb using the 
 M-Y-T algorithm is shown below (generated by JFLAP with the epsilon
 transitions between the final abb removed). <br/>
<img src="./Images/dragonNFA.png" height=190px width=620px>
<br>
Applying Subset Construction to the NFA will give you  this DFA:
<p>
<table border=1 style="padding:4px;">
<tr>
<td>NFA States </td> <td>DFA State</td><td>a</td><td>b</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>{q0,q1,q2,q4,q7} </td>      <td>D0</td> <td>D1</td> <td>D2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>{q1,q2,q3,q4,q6,q7,q8} </td> <td>D1</td> <td>D1</td> <td>D3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>{q1,q2,q4,q5,q6,q7} </td>    <td>D2</td> <td>D1</td> <td>D2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>{q1,q2,q4,q5,q6,q7,q9} </td> <td>D3</td> <td>D1</td> <td>D4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>{q1,q2,q4,q5,q6,q7,q10} </td> <td>D4</td> <td>D1</td> <td>D2</td>
</tr>

</table>
<br>
The accepting state is the only state that holds q10, which is D4.
 (You stop constructing new D-states until no new D-states result.)
<p>
Corresponding Graph generated by JFLAP 
<p>
 Note: q0=D0, q1=D1, q2=D2, q3=D3, q4=D4.
 The subsets do not correspond to the table above because the extra
 lamdba transitions were not removed from the NFA before applying subset
 construction. The resulting NFA is correct.<p>
