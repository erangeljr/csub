Register Usage (set in gencode.h):
mp 6 - memory pointer register - points to top of memory for temp storage
gp 5 - global pointer register - points to bottom of memory for global storage 
ac 0 - accumulator register
ac1 1 - 2nd accumulator register

  Standard prelude:
  0:     LD  6,0(0) 	load maxaddress from location 0 into mp (register 6)
  1:     ST  0,0(0) 	store 0 at address 0 (clear memory)

  2:    LDC  0,11(0)  Load constant 11 into accumulator ac (register 0)
  3:     ST  0,0(5)   Store value in ac to address at 0 offset from gp  
  4:    LDC  0,13(0)  Load constant 13 into ac 
  5:     ST  0,1(5)   Store value in ac to address 1 offset from gp (reg 5)
  6:    LDC  0,17(0)  Load constant 17 into ac
  7:     ST  0,2(5)   Store value in ac to address 2 offset from gp (reg 5)
  8:   HALT  0,0,0
