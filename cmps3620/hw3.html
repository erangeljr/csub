<h3>Homework 3 - Chapters 3 and 4</h3>
Due: Friday October 10, 2014 at 11:55pm
<p>
Update: Questions 8-10 deferred to Homework 4 since we won't cover them this week.
</p><p>
Answer the following questions. Each question is worth 1 point.
</p><ol>
<li>If a packet from the network layer is broken into 10 frames and each frame 
    has a 20% chance of being corrupted in transit, how many frames on average 
    will be transmitted before the whole packet is received without error? 
    Answer this question for the following types of data link protocols:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>A data link protocol that does no frame retransmission or error 
        detection. So if a frame is corrupted in transit, the data link layer
        will not detect it. The responsibility for error detection and recovery
        is on the higher layers (ie the network or transport layer will 
        retransmit the whole packet).
    </li><li>A data link protocol with error detection that will retransmit a frame
        that is corrupted in transit using selective repeat.
   </li></ol>
    Hint: Use the Binomial Distribution calculations for determining the 
    probability of success for part (a).
</li><li>The message 0110 0111 1110 0000 0111 1110 1111 1001 is to be transmitted. 
    Show the bit sequence for the message if it is encoded using the following 
    framing methods:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Flag bytes with byte stuffing. FLAG = 0111 1110, ESC = 1110 0000
    </li><li>Starting and ending flag bits with bit stuffing, FLAG = 0111 1110
    </li></ol>
</li><li>The character 'A' is represented in 8-bit ASCII as the bit string 
    01000001. You are transmitting 'A' with an even-parity Hamming code. 
    <ol type="a">
    <li>What is the bit string that is transmitted? Show all work in computing 
        each check bit, not just the resulting message.
    </li><li>Suppose that while your answer to part (a) is in transit, bit 7 is 
        corrupted (it flips to the opposite value). Show how the receiver would
        detect and correct this error.
    </li></ol>
</li><li>Compute the CRC checksum for 0110 0010 1111 1110 divided by the 
    generator polynomial 1001. Show all work (similar to Figure 3.8 in the 
    book).
</li><li>Under what conditions would error correcting codes be preferred 
    over error detection with retransmission?
</li><li>What features of the physical line should be considered when choosing a 
    sending window size for a sliding window protocol? Remember that one 
    purpose of sliding window is to keep the line in use as much as possible.
</li><li>Why do most data link protocols put the frame checksum in the 
    footer instead of in the header?
<strike>
</strike></li><li><strike>Describe how the delay and throughput would differ between pure 
    ALOHA and slotted ALOHA under the following conditions. Which would be 
    higher? Explain why.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Low load (few stations transmitting)
    </li><li>High load (many stations transmitting)
    </li></ol>
</strike></li><li><strike>Describe how the delay and throughput would differ between 
    1-persistent CSMA and non-persistent CSMA.
</strike></li><li><strike>You are designing a network that will use CSMA/CD for contention. 
    The physical media has the following characteristics: 1.5Mbps, signal 
    speed is 2/3rds the speed of light and maximum cable length is 500m.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>How long would the contention slot have to be?
    </li><li>What would be the minimum frame size (i.e. how long would a frame have 
        to be so it takes longer to transmit than the length of a contetion 
        slot)?
    </li></ol>
</strike>
</li></ol>
