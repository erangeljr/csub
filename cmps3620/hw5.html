<h3>Homework 5 - Chapter 5</h3>
<ol>
<li>In order to deliver IP packets to the destination host on an Ethernet LAN, 
    the gateway router translates the IP address to a MAC address using ARP. Is
    ARP part of the data link layer or the network layer?
</li><li>Do virtual circuit subnets need to use a routing algorithm that finds a 
    path from any source to any destination? If so, at what point during a 
    virtual circuit connection would this algorithm be needed?
</li><li>Under what circumstances might a packet be delivered to the wrong 
    destination or get lost in transit at the network layer?
</li><li>A subnet has the same topology as given in Figure 5.13 on page 363. The
    routers receive the following new link state packets: 
    (A, SEQ, Age, B 7, E 3), (B, SEQ, Age, A 7, C 4, F 4), 
    (C, SEQ, Age, B 4, D 5, E 2), (D, SEQ, Age, C 5, F 6), 
    (E, SEQ, Age, A 3, C 2, F 10), (F, SEQ, Age, B 4, D 6, E 10). 
    Compute the new shortest path(s) from A to all other routers.
</li><li>Describe how choke packets and load shedding differ for congestion control
    in datagram subnets.
</li><li>Describe how tunneling can be used in a datagram subnet. 
</li><li>An ISP offers static IP services over DSL. In their advertisement, they
say they will allocate an 8 address subnet for each subscriber.
<ol type="a">
<li>What is the netmask for this subnet? 
</li><li>Will all 8 addresses be available for use by the user? Explain your answer.
</li></ol>
</li><li>A router has received 206.45.68.0/22, 206.45.72.0/22 and 206.45.76.0/22.
All use the same outgoing line. Can the router aggregate them? If so, give
the aggregated address. If not, explain why not.
</li><li>A router has an aggregated block with the address 19.28.0.0/17. A set of
1024 addresses within that block, 19.28.60.0 to 19.28.63.255, is assigned to
a different outgoing line than the rest of the block. Will the router have to
deaggregate 19.28.0.0/17? Explain your answer.
</li><li>A router has the following entries in its routing table:
<pre>     Address/mask        Interface
     138.168.0.0/16      eth0
     192.168.1.0/24      eth1
     71.138.209.16/29    eth2
     default             eth3
</pre>
Which interface will be used for packets with the following IP addresses?
<ol type="a">
<li>136.168.201.110
</li><li>71.138.209.157
</li><li>192.168.1.50
</li><li>71.138.209.18
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
