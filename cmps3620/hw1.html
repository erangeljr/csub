<h3>Homework 1 - Chapters 1 and 2</h3>
Due: Friday by 4:00pm
<p>
Answer the following questions. Each question is worth 1 point.
</p><ol>
<li>Give two motivations for using a protocol stack.
</li><li>Consider a system with a 6 layer protocol stack. Layers 2 through 
5 each add a 10 byte header. Layer 2 also adds a 4 byte footer. If a 
52 byte message is generated at layer 6, what percentage of the bits 
transmitted over the physical media are overhead (headers and footers)?
</li><li>If the unit exchanged at the data link level is called a frame and
the unit exchanged at the network level is called a packet, do frames
encapsulate packets or do packets encapsulate frames?
</li><li>Describe the differences between a byte stream and an unacknowledged
datagram.
</li><li>List two advantages to having standardized protocols.
</li><li>Assume there is no noise on a voice-grade telephone line and the data
is transmitted using 2 discrete signal levels. What is the maximum data rate 
if the channel is sampled every 1 msec?
</li><li>If the signal-to-noise ratio is 20dB, what is the maximum data rate
on a standard voice-grade telephone line?
</li><li>One method of transmitting data is to use portable media transported
from one point to another. Consider a box of tapes. The box contains 20 
tapes and each tape can hold 800GB of data. The tapes are transported by 
courier at 65mph. At what distance does the data transfer rate of this
method become equivalent to setting up a dedicated OC-12 link (601.344 Mbps) 
between the two points. 
</li><li>List two ways that fiber optic cables differ from coax cables.
</li><li>Does 802.11 use regulated or unregulated frequency bands?
