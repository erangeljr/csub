<h3>Lab 7 - TCP Initial Sequence Number Vulnerability</h3>
Due: Friday by 12:30pm
<p>
One issue with the selection of an initial sequence number (ISN) for the TCP 
connection is spoofing. If the initial sequence number is guessable, an
attacker can spoof the TCP handshake. The canonical attack has three 
parties: A the spoofed host, B the hapless server, X the attacker. The
attacker first floods A to prevent it from receiving messages from B.
This can be accomplished by any number of denial of service attacks. The
attacker then connects to B to get sequence number data from B. Let's 
call this sequence number ISNb. If B is using a sequence number scheme 
that is easy to guess, the attacker can extrapolate the next sequence 
number(s) that B will use. Let's call this number ISNb'. The attacker 
will then connect to B pretending to be A. B will send a reply to A, that 
will never get there due to the denial of service on A, that contains 
B's sequence number, z. If the attacker has guessed correctly, z = ISNb'.
The attacker can then spoof an acknowledgement of ISNb', and B will be
tricked into thinking it has a connection with A. The flow of events can
be summarized as follows:
</p><pre>   X-&gt;A: Flood A                &lt;--- Denial of service
   X-&gt;B: SYN, ISNx              &lt;--- Attacker makes legitimate connection to B
   B-&gt;X: SYN, ISNb, ACK(ISNx+1) &lt;--- From ISNb, X can guess next ISN, ISNb'
   X-&gt;B: Closes connection      &lt;--- Legit connection no longer needed
   Ax-&gt;B: SYN, ISNx'            &lt;--- From attacker, spoofing A
   B-&gt;A: SYN, z, ACK(ISNx'+1)   &lt;--- Goes to real A, attacker does not see z, guesses z = ISNb'
   Ax-&gt;B: ACK(ISNb'+1)          &lt;--- X uses guessed ISNb' to generate ACK
</pre>
If the attacker can also guess how B will increment its sequence number during
the connection, then the attacker can continue sending data to B while posing
as A. The increment is usually the size of the data that B sends. This can be 
guessed if the application protocol uses relatively fixed sized responses from
B for certain input. 
<p>
Note that if the attacker can also guess ISNb' without connecting to B (such as 
if B is using a clock-based sequence number), then the connection from X-&gt;B 
is not needed and the attacker can skip down to the Ax-&gt;B step. 
</p><p>
Also note that the attacker does not even need to be able to see packets traveling 
from B to A to make this attack succeed. As long as B uses a guessable sequence
number generator and sends predictably sized responses, the attacker can guess
the appropriate sequence number to use in the ACK field without any additional
input.

The following papers, whitepages and advisories give more details about the
ISN vulnerability:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~rtm/papers/117.pdf">Robert Morris, A Weakness in the 4.2BSD Unix TCP/IP Software</a> - 1985 <br>
This details the above scenario and how it is particularly easy on the 4.2BSD 
kernel. The 4.2BSD kernel increments the sequence number by fixed amounts, 
which makes it easy to guess the next sequence number to be used by the server.
</li><li><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/ipext.ps">Steve Bellovin, Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite</a> - 1989 <br>
This paper proposes some solutions to the ISN problem. One solution is to use
randomized increments, since any time-based increments can be guessed. Another
solution is to use a cryptographic ISN generator with a well-chosen key.
</li><li><a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1995-01.html">CERT Advisory CA-1995-01: IP Spoofing Attacks and Hijacked Terminal Connections</a> - Jan 1995 (original), Sep 1997 (revised) <br>
This advisory highlights how spoofing can be used to hijack a system or 
overcome IP-based authentication.
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1948.txt">RFC 1948: Defending Against Sequence Number Attacks</a> - May 1996 <br>
This RFC proposes a solution for the ISN selection problem. The solution is
to have a sequence number space for each connection. This is accomplished by
adding a hash of the connection information (srcIP, dstIP, srcPort, dstPort)
to the old ISN generator (timer based). The hash should also include some 
secret data (not guessable). It does not solve the issue of an attacker that
can see all of the handshake. Such an attacker can still guess sequence 
numbers of an ongoing connection.

This advisory gives more information about the statistical weakness of using 
pseudo-random increments. It also gives more detailed information about the 
variations on the attack that can be used. It gives several approaches that 
can be used to mitigate the problem.

Two interesting whitepapers by Michal Zalewski give a graphical 
representation of the ISN generator. The author analyzed various ISN generators
and plotted them on a graph. The more the points in the graph cluster, the
easier it would be for an attacker to guess the next sequence number. A table
below each graph also summarizes the attack feasibility for that graph as a
percentage. The higher the percentage, the more likely an attacker is to be
able to guess the sequence number. 

The first whitepaper is 
<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/oldtcp/tcpseq.html">Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis</a> 
published in 2001. 

The second whitepaper is
<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/newtcp/">Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis - One Year Later</a> 
published in 2002. 
Read through both of these whitepapers to see the importance of a good initial 
sequence number.
<p>
Another intriguing consequence of this research into ISN predictability is
using the ISN to fingerprint the system. Even if the operating system has taken
care to make its ISN unpredictable, if it has a unique ISN generator, it can
still be identified. Take for example the
<a href="http://insecure.org/nmap/osdetect/osdetect-methods.html">Nmap
fingerprinting methods</a>.
Michal Zalewski also covers this issue in Chapter 10 of his book
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/1593270461/">Silence on the Wire</a>. 
</p><p>
</p><h4>Questions</h4>
Upload the answers to these questions as your lab writeup.
<ol>
<li>Look at the graph for Cisco IOS in the original Strange Attractors article 
and the 2002 followup. How has Cisco's ISN generator changed? Is this change 
for the better?
</li><li>Besides Cisco IOS, name three operating systems that performed poorly in
original Strange Attractors article.
</li><li>Of the poor performers from Question 2, have any improved their generator
in the 2002 followup article?
</li><li>One of the common recommedations in the above articles is to use a 
cryptographically secure protocol for communication instead of TCP. Give
your theory as to why this has not become a widespread solution.
</li><li>Why is the ability to fingerprint a system based on the ISNs a concern?
</li></ol>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
The following is not required to complete the lab, but is interesting to note.

<h4>Similar Weaknesses in Other TCP/IP Fields</h4>
IPv4 supports packet fragmentation, with the packet identification and the 
fragment offset used to reconstruct the original packet. The IP specification
requires that the identification field (ID) be unique for every 
source/destination/protocol tuple within the maximum packet lifetime setting 
(typically two minutes). Originally, the specification also recommended that 
the ID field be uniquely set for all packets, even if they are not fragmented 
(RFC 6864 from Feb 2013 recommends that unique IDs only be used on fragmented
packets and allows the ID to be repeated in non-fragmented packets).
<p>
Since the specification originally required unique IDs for all packets within
the maximum packet lifetime, many systems used a very predictable method of
generating ID values, such as increasing the value by 1 for each new 
source/destination/protocol tuple. One can use this predictability to 
gauge how many packets a machine has processed since you last connected to
them. This can be useful as a side-channel attack to portmap a victim.
This method is used by Nmap to do their 
<a href="http://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html">IP ID scan (Idle scan)</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, an attacker can use this predictability to interfer with normal
fragment reassembly by injecting spoofed packets into the subnet. This can
cause destruction of data (spurious injected fragments), intentional changes
to data (specially crafted fragments to overwrite other legitimate fragments),
or interception of data. See the following paper for more details:
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/woot11/tech/final_files/Gilad.pdf">Fragmentation Considered Vulnerable</a> by Yossi Gilad and Amir Herzburg.

</p><h4>Half-Open Connections and SYN Cookies</h4>
A popular denial of service attack is to flood a server with spoofed SYN 
packets and/or to use a botnet to send SYN packets (without spoofing). When 
the server receives a SYN packet, it stores the connection information in a
table and then sends out the SYN/ACK. If the SYN/ACK is never responded to
(with either an ACK or a RST), the entry stays in the table and the table 
space can be quickly exhausted. This is the basis of a SYN flood attack.
<p>
SYN cookies are a way to create the server's ISN such that the server doesn't
need to store information in the connection table to realize an incoming ACK
is the last packet of the connection establishment handshake. There is also 
an extension header (TCP Cookie Transactions) which supports a similar 
exchange, but it requires both the client and server understand the extension
header (e.g. it can be easily bypassed by a non-compliant botnet). 
</p><p>
The SYN cookie consists of a timestamp (5 bits), an encoded maximum segment
size (MSS) requested for the transaction (3 bits), and a cryptographic hash 
computed over the src IP, src port, dest IP, dest port tuple and the timestamp 
(24 bits). This is sent as the server's chosen ISN. (Note: there is some 
predictability here because of the timestamp and encoded MSS). When the client
sends the ACK with the server's ISN+1, the server subtracts 1 and verifies 
the timestamp and cryptographic hash.
