<h3>Lab 1 - Command Line Networking Tools</h3>
Due: Tuesday by 4:00pm
<p>
The purpose of this lab is to become familiar with standard command-line
TCP/IP tools that can be used in Unix/Linux systems (with equivalents on
other operating systems).
</p><p>
There are several command line tools in Unix/Linux systems that can give 
you information about certain aspects of TCP/IP networking. This lab will
investigate the following tools:
</p><dl>
<dt>dig</dt>
<dd>This tool gives you information about DNS (domain name) records. The
most simple use of dig is to look up the IP address for a given domain 
name or vis versa. It can also give you much more information, such as the
"start of authority" (soa) or "mail exchanger" (mx) for the domain. 
<p>
Examples:
</p><blockquote>
dig www.google.com
<br>
dig -x 136.168.201.112
<br>
dig soa www.cs.csub.edu
<br>
</blockquote>
See "man dig" for more information.
</dd>
<dt>ping</dt>
<dd>This tool sends a query to the destination server to see if it is still
responding to packets. A response to ping means the destination is online.
Ping will tell you how long it took for the packets to travel if there is a
response. If there is no response, the server may be offline or just blocking
ping requests. See "man ping" for more information.
<p>
Usage: ping &lt;IP | domain name&gt;
</p></dd>
<dt>traceroute</dt>
<dd>This tool attempts to determine the route taken to the destination machine
and how long it takes to travel to each node along the route. It is helpful
for determining where network connectivity is lost when one cannot connect to
a remote machine or for seeing where lag is occuring when a connection is
laggy. See "man traceroute" for more information.
<p>
Usage: tracreroute &lt;IP | domain name&gt; <br>
       traceroute -n &lt;IP | domain name&gt;
</p></dd>
</dl>
Log in to Sleipnir and try these tools. Give different domain names and IP
addresses to each one to see what happens. 

<h4>Writeup</h4>
Answer the following questions and upload the writeup to your Moodle account.
Use only plain text, Open Office or PDF formats for your writeup.
<ol>
<li>Write a paragraph about what happened when you tried using these tools
with various domain names and IP addresses as suggested above. 
</li><li>The dig command can be used to obtain information from the DNS records 
for a given domain name or IP address. What is the output for the following 
commands and what is the difference between them?
<ol type="a">
<li>dig www.cs.csub.edu
</li><li>dig soa www.cs.csub.edu
</li></ol>
</li><li>You are getting probes from some host in the 209.9.244.* (Class C) network. Which of the following commands will find the Start of Authority record for that network (the answer section will have an authority server that is NOT a root name server)?
<ol type="a">
<li>dig soa 224.9.209.in-addr.arpa
</li><li>dig soa 209.9.224
</li></ol>
</li><li>You are attempting to connect to ftp.foo.com and get the error message<br>
--- unknown host ftp.foo.com --- <br>
What is the likely problem and what commands would you use to investigate the problem?
</li><li>Suppose instead you got the message<br>
Trying 208.207.151.35 ... <br>
... Connection timed out. <br>
How does this differ from the previous error message? What could be causing the issue? How would you investigate it?
</li></ol>
