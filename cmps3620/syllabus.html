Catalog Description
</div>
<div class="abet-label">CMPS 3620 Computer Networks (5)</div>
A study of computer networks focusing on the TCP/IP Internet protocols 
and covering in detail the four layers: physical, data link, network, and 
transport. This course includes a laboratory in which students will cover
important network utilities, debugging tools, process and thread control
as it relates to network programming, and the coding of programs which do
interprocess communication over sockets. The typical Internet client program
which accesses a TCP network server daemon will be covered in detail.
Each week lecture meets for 200 minutes and lab meets for 150 minutes.

ABET Outcome Coverage
</div>

The course maps to the following performance indicators for 
Computer Science (CAC/ABET):
<dl class="abetdl">
<dt>(CAC PIa1): Apply and perform the correct mathematical analysis.
</dt>
<dd>Apply statistical methods including the binomial and Poisson distributions 
    to analyze common networking scenarios such as Ethernet contention, error 
    rates, queueing theory, and channel efficiency. 
<dd>
<dt>(CAC PIa2): Prepare and solve the appropriate physical model of the problem.
</dt>
<dd>Apply Shannon's law and Nyquist's theorem to appropriate models of the 
    physical layer of the networking stack.
</dd>
<dt>(CAC PIe2): Recognize and describe current issues in security.
</dt>
<dd>Describe at least one protocol that adds security to the TCP/IP protocol 
    stack. Analyze scenarios involving network security such as the 
    appropriate use of security techniques for a given scenario or the 
    limitations of common encryption protocols. 
</dd>
<dt>(CAC PIi1): Program in a suitable computer language.
</dt>
<dd>Use the socket API for the TCP/IP protocol stack to code a simple 
    client-server application in the C programming language. 
</dd>
<dt>(CAC PIi3): Utilize problem solving skills and techniques to complete
    the task.
</dt>
<dd>Analyze common networking scenarios and apply the appropriate techniques 
    to derive a solution.

Course Notes
</div>
The lectures will focus extensively on the theory of networking and the
details of several popular networking protocols (e.g. Ethernet, 802.11,
TCP/IP, etc). The theory has a strong mathematics component, particularly
for calculating probabilities of events. A brief background of probabilty
and statistical methods will be presented in class for students who have
not taken the probability course in Mathematics.

<div class="abet-header">
Attendance
</div>
Students are responsible for their own attendance. The topics covered
in lecture will be listed on the course website. Lab attendance is not
required but is strongly encouraged.

<div class="abet-header">
Academic Integrity Policy
</div>
Assignments may discussed in groups. If the assignment is a group
assignment, the group turns in one assignment for the entire group.
However, if the assignment is an individual assignment, each student
must turn in their own work; no direct copying is allowed. You may
discuss individual assignments with other students, but you must write
up the assignment in your own words. Any direct copying from other students,
the textbook, Internet resources, etc. that the instructor detects will 
result in a grade of 0 for that assignment. Refer to the Academic Integrity
policy in the campus catalog.

<div class="abet-header">
Computer Labs Outside of Class
</div>
The CEE/CS Tutoring Center in Sci III 324 is available for use by students
in this course outside of class time on a first come, first serve basis.
Priority in the lab is given to students who are completing assignments
for CEE/CS courses. See the schedule on the door for hours the lab will be
open.
<p>
There are also computers available in the CEE/CS Major Study Lounge in Sci
III 341 (formerly the CEE/CS Library). This room is only open when faculty
members are on campus, e.g. approximately 8am to 5pm on weekdays. If the
door is currently locked, see Steve, Erika, myself, or another faculty member
to unlock it.

Homework/Lab Policies
</div>
Labs will be group assignments. Each group, consisting of 1-3 students,
will turn in one assignment for the entire group. Be sure all names are
on the assignment so all group members receive credit.
<p>
Homeworks may be discussed in groups, but every student must turn in their
own assignments in their own words. Refer to the Academic Integrity Policy
above.
<p>
Assignments will be posted online on the course website. The due date will
be given with the assignment.

<div class="abet-header">
Late Policy
</div>
Late labs are accepted. Partial credit will be given for
incomplete labs. 
<p>
Late homework is accepted.

<div class="abet-header">
Homework/Lab Submission
</div>
Assignments are submitted by emailing the instructor from the CEE/CS
department server (coding assignments) or by attaching files to
the Moodle website (non-coding assignments). All files must be in text,
OpenOffice or PDF format. If scanning a hand-written page, use a standard
image format such as JPG, PNG, or GIF, or use PS or PDF format.

<div class="abet-header">
Final
</div>
May 2020<br>
<p>
If you cannot make the scheduled final time because it conflicts with another
final or you have more than two finals scheduled that day, you MUST contact
the instructor ONE WEEK in advance of the final to schedule an alternate time.
