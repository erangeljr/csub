<h3>Lab 6 - Sample Shell and Telnet Programs</h3>
Due: Friday by 12:30pm
<p>
In <a href="./lab5.html" target="_blank">Lab 5</a>, a "dummy" shell was spawned
by your simple daemon since your daemon did not authenticate users. This was
done for security reasons to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your
files. You also used the <code>telnet</code> command to connect to your daemon.
In this lab, we will be looking at code which implements a more realistic shell
and which investigates the telnet protocol.
</p><p>
Create a new directory for this lab (important so that the tarball does not
overwrite vcrec.c, vcsend.c and other files you have created in previous labs).
Download and untar the networking code provided by Dr. Marc Thomas using the 
commands:
</p><pre>wget http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~eddie/cmps3620/code/lab6/cs376_lab_code.tar.gz
tar -xvzf cs376_lab_code.tar.gz
</pre>
The two files of interest for this lab are <code>s_sh.c</code> (the shell
program) and <code>s_tlnt.c</code> (a verbose telnet client). Compile these
two programs with the following command:
<pre>make telnet
</pre>
For the shell program, you can run the shell with the command 
<code>./s_sh</code> and then interact with the shell using regular 
stdin (the keyboard) and stdout (the screen). It is VERY IMPORTANT that you 
do NOT compile this in the same directory as Lab 5, to prevent simple daemon 
from using this version of s_sh for its shell. This shell is a multi-platform
program which parses commands and command options, runs the commands and 
displays the results. This program can parse a few commands such as cd, dir 
and pwd. It also supports one * or ? wildcard per line. The comments section 
at the top of the file lists more details on the capacity of this shell program. 
<p>
Some interesting things to look at in the code for <code>s_sh.c</code> is how
it parses the typed command, how it spawns the system binaries for certain 
commands, how it stores a history of typed commands and how it implements 
internal commands. This mimics much of what a regular shell program, such as 
bash, would do. 
</p><p>
The telnet program <code>s_tlnt</code> is also a multi-platform program. It
gives more information about the telnet process than the regular telnet client
does. The telnet protocol allows one to have a plaintext (unencrypted, SSH by
comparison is encrypted) TCP connection which can support virtual terminals.
It was widely used in the early days of the Internet for logging into remote
sites and is still widely used for debugging other plaintext protocols such as 
how we used it for Lab 5.
</p><p>
Some interesting things to look at in the <code>s_tlnt.c</code> code are 
<code>process_esc()</code> and the <code>commandmode</code> jump target in 
<code>main()</code>. The <code>process_esc()</code> function interprets basic 
VT100/ANSI escape sequences. VT100 and ANSI are standards to control the 
placement of the cursor on a text screen, colors, reverse colors, blinking 
text, clearing the screen and other such functionality needed to create basic 
text-based graphical interfaces. If you use Pine, you've seen VT100 and ANSI 
in action. 
</p><p>
The <code>commandmode</code> jump target can be reached by pressing 
CTRL-T (the "escape character") while the program is running. This will bring
up the <code>s_tlnt</code> prompt. Your connection will still be active
in the background while you give commands to the <code>s_tlnt</code> program. 
You can "close" an active connection, "return" to an active connection, "open" 
a new connection, set <code>s_tlnt</code> parameters, access a "help" screen 
and see the "status" at the <code>s_tlnt</code> prompt. The parameters can 
enable features which will give more information about the data being passed
across the network, such as VT100 codes.
</p><p>
The command to start <code>s_tlnt</code> is:
</p><pre>s_tlnt [-v] [-snoopy] hostname port</pre>
The v option will turn on verbose, which will give you detailed information
about the execution of the program. You can also set "verbose" or "noverbose" 
at the <code>s_tlnt</code> prompt. The snoopy option activates transparent 
mode, which gives information about telnet arbitration and shows all control 
and 8bit characters. Telnet arbitration is a negociation process that occurs
between your telnet client and the server to set options such as echoing the
text you type or whether to use half-duplex or full-duplex communication. The
negociation process consists of one side presenting an option (IAC DO) 
and the other side either accepting (IAC WILL) or rejecting (IAC WONT) 
the option. 
You can set "snoopy" or "nosnoopy" at the 
<code>s_tlnt</code> prompt.

</p><h4>Lab Writeup</h4>
Answer these questions as the writeup for your lab.
<ol>
<li>Why does <code>s_sh</code> watch for the SIGCLD (SIG_CHLD) signal?
</li><li>How are the internal commands in <code>s_sh</code> implemented? 
</li><li>In <code>process_esc</code> in <code>s_tlnt</code>, basic ANSI/VT100 
    support is provided. Read the comments at the start of this function. 
    How do you think Pine provides a "graphical" text interface using these
    escape sequences?
</li><li>Why does <code>s_tlnt</code> also contain code to parse a command line?
    Hint: Think about when does <code>s_tlnt</code> provides a shell-like
    prompt to the user.
</li><li>Notice that both the <code>s_sh</code> and <code>s_tlnt</code> source
    code files contain references to the code being able to run on multiple
    platforms, such as Windows or Linux. How is this done within the source
    code files?
