<h3>Lab 5 - Handling Multiple Clients</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this lab is to learn how to handle multiple clients in a 
TCP/IP server using children processes and signal handling. 
</p><p>
For this lab, we will be looking at <code>simple_daemon.c</code> and
<code>simple_shell.c</code> from the code tarball
<a href="https://www.cs.csub.edu/~eddie/cmps3620/code/lab5/lab5_files.tgz" target="_blank">lab5_files.tgz</a>. Download
the tarball with:
</p><pre>wget http://www.cs.csub.edu/~eddie/cmps3620/code/lab5/lab5_files.tgz
</pre>
Compile the program with the command:
<pre>make daemon
</pre>
<p>
The <code>s_daemon</code> program is a very simple TCP/IP server that will host
up to MAX_CHILDREN concurrent clients.  The program name comes from a Unix 
naming convention which calls servers "daemons" (hence many server programs 
having the letter "d" in their name, such as sshd, named and so on). This is a 
very simple, unauthenticated, plain-text Internet daemon. 
</p><p>
Once a client has connected, <code>s_daemon</code> forks a child process to 
handle that client. The child process then spawns a <code>s_shell</code> 
process to interact with the user. The <code>s_shell</code> program is a very 
limited shell since there is no authentication with this server. We must spawn
a seperate process to interact with the user because <code>s_daemon</code> can
only interact with one client at a time in a single-threaded or single process
mode. <code>s_daemon</code>'s child process handles the data passing over the
TCP socket while the <code>s_shell</code> process actually processes the data
and does something semi-useful. 
</p><p>
From <code>s_shell</code>'s perspective, it is interacting with the user via
standard in and standard out, not a socket. This is because 
<code>s_daemon</code> sends the data it receives from the socket into the
stdin pipe for <code>s_shell</code>. Likewise, <code>s_daemon</code> reads 
the data coming off <code>s_shell</code>'s stdout pipe and sends that over
the socket. This is a division of labor where the daemon focuses purely on
managing sockets while the shell focuses on interacting with the user. 
</p><p>
To start <code>s_daemon</code>, use the command:
</p><pre>./s_daemon
</pre>
<p>
The program will display the port number to which daemon is bound. Open another 
terminal and try to telnet to the daemon. For example, if it says it is on
port number 19234, the command would be:
</p><pre>telnet localhost 19234
</pre>
To end the connection, within the telnet application either give the command
"quit" or type the keyboard sequence CRTL-]. The "quit" command in 
<code>s_shell</code> will terminate the connection from the server side.
The CTRL-] keyboard sequenced causes telnet to suspend the connection and 
give you a telnet shell which looks like <code>telnet&gt;</code>. From here, 
you can give the command "close" to terminate the current connection from the 
client side. Then you can give the command "quit" to exit telnet.
<p>
To kill the <code>s_daemon</code> process, return to the terminal you were 
running it in and give the CTRL-C sequence. <code>simple_daemon.c</code> has a 
signal handler for CTRL-C which will call <code>parent_terminate()</code>. 
This function cleans up after the process before exiting.
</p><p>
Try running the daemon with just one telnet connection at first. Then run the
daemon with multiple telnet connections at the same time (you will need one 
terminal for each connection). Pay attention to what is printed to the daemon 
terminal when children connect and disconnect. 
</p><p>
The process flow is roughly as follows:
</p><pre>     s_daemon parent              s_daemon child             s_shell process
     ---------------              --------------             ---------------
     bind the socket
     listen on socket
 --&gt; accept connection
|    fork child        -------&gt;  dialog_with_client
 --- repeat                        create pipes
                                   spawn s_shell  --------&gt;  read from stdin pipe
                              --&gt;  set up select       |     process command
                             |     if socket data      |     write to stdout pipe
                             |       read socket        ---  repeat while not quit
                             |       send to s_shell
                             |     if s_shell data
                             |       read s_shell
                             |       send to socket
                              ---  repeat until error
                                     or exit
</pre>

<h4>Lab Writeup</h4>
Answer the following questions as your lab writeup. Submit your answers via
Moodle.
<ol>
<li>Unlike vcrec.c, which could only accept a single connection at a time, 
    simple_daemon.c can accept multiple connections at once. How does it 
    accomplish this?
</li><li>Try giving a CTRL-C in a telnet terminal. Why does this not cause telnet to exit?
</li><li>What happens when you connect to s_daemon with multiple simultaneous telnet
    commands? Is there any "overlap" in the commands you type in each s_shell
    window (i.e. do you get the output for commands typed in another window)?
</li><li>Which signals will cause simple_daemon.c to exit gracefully via parent_terminate()?
</li><li>In dialog_with_client(), the actual work of sending and receiving data 
    from the children processes is done. How does this code tell when you have 
    terminated the connection by giving the s_shell command "quit"?
</li><li>What does the child_terminate() function do? How does it differ from the
    kill_child() function?
</li><li>Given what you have learned in this lab, how do you think the SSH daemon 
    on Sleipnir handles an incoming SSH connection from Putty? Hint: look at 
    the command ps x right after you've logged in to Sleipnir and note what 
    processes you have running. 
</li></ol>
