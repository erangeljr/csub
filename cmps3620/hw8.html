<li>One common feature of popular PHP forum software is the "Keep me logged 
    in" feature where the website sends an authentication cookie after the 
    user types an appropriate username and password. On future visits, if the 
    cookie is present, the user does not have to provide a password. What are 
    the security implications of such a feature? 
</li><li>One general principle behind authentication is "what you know", i.e. 
    asking the user for information only the user can provide. Give another 
    principle that can be used for authentication. 
</li><li>At what level in the protocol stack (e.g. data link, network, etc) must a 
    stateful inspection firewall that is aware of the File Transfer Protocol 
    (FTP) operate? Justify your answer.
</li><li>What is the purpose of an intrusion detection system (IDS)? How does this
    differ from an intrusion prevention system (IPS)?
</li><li>Can cryptography provide solutions for confidentiality, integrity,
    nonrepudiation, and availability? Explain why or why not.
</li><li>What is the primary difference between symmetric key and public key 
    encryption algorithms?
</li><li>What is the purpose of a public key infrastructure or a trusted link
    system such as certificate authorities?
</li><li>A fundamental cryptographic principle states that all messages must have 
    redundancy. But redundancy helps an intruder tell if a guessed plaintext 
    is correct. Consider two forms of redundancy. First, the initial n bits 
    of the plaintext contain a known pattern. Second, the final n bits of 
    the message contain a hash over the message. From a security point of 
    view, are these two equivalent? Discuss your answer.
</li><li>When using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, why is it difficult to protect 
    against a man-in-the-middle attack when neither party has any a priori 
    knowledge of each other, such as the server public key in SSH? 
</li><li>Let's revisit Question 1. Would it be any more secure to use a Kerberos 
    ticket for the "Keep me logged in" feature? Why or why not?
