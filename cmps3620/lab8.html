<h3>Lab 8 - Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol</h3>
Due: Friday by 12:30pm
<p>
One network security related protocol not mentioned in the book is the SSH 
protocol. This protocol allows encrypted shell sessions and encrypted file 
transfer sessions between the client and server. One issue in unsecure LANs
is that others can sniff your password (and anything sent between the client
and server) when you use a plaintext application such as telnet or FTP. SSH 
provides an encrypted alternative to these applications so that sniffing is
not as easy. Note: as with any cryptographic protocol, if someone figures 
out how to break the underlaying cryptographic algorithms, they can recover 
the plaintext from the encrypted session. 
</p><p>
The two main developers of SSH servers are 
<a href="http://www.ssh.com/">Tectia (formerly SSH Communications Security)</a>
and <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>. The original SSH code was 
written by Tatu Yl�nen and released freely. Tatu Yl�nen went on
to form SSH Communications Security, which is a proprietary company. It
changed its name to Tectia Corporation in 2010. OpenSSH was developed from 
Tatu Yl�nen's free code and is open source. The OpenSSH server is widely 
used by many Unix/Linux based servers.
</p><p>
There are also many free SSH clients for various platforms, such as the Putty 
program for Windows. Most Linux distributions use the client software provided 
by OpenSSH. There are also proprietary SSH clients for a variety of platforms.
</p><p>
Like many network related protocols, SSH was developed first then standardized.
IETF formed a working group called secsh to develop the RFCs. The working
group has now dissolved. The main RFCs out of that working group are:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4253.txt">RFC 4253 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4251.txt">RFC 4251 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4252.txt">RFC 4252 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4250.txt">RFC 4250 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4254.txt">RFC 4254 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4344.txt">RFC 4344 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Encryption Modes</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4419.txt">RFC 4419 - Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4432.txt">RFC 4432 - RSA Key Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol</a>
</li></ul>
<h4>Assignment</h4>
Read through the RFCs and answer the following questions. You might also find
it helpful to read through Chapter 8 of the book, which talks about public
key encryption, symmetric key encryption and key exchanges.
<ol>
<li>Does SSH encrypt the TCP/IP headers or just the payload?
</li><li>In brief, what is the purpose of including a message digest (MAC)?
</li><li>What is a key exchange and why is it used in SSH?
</li><li>Does SSH support public key, symmetric key or both?
</li><li>Why is Diffie-Hellman key exchange appealing?
</li></ol>
