<h3>Homework 7 - Chapters 7 and 8</h3>
Due: Friday November 21, 2014 at 11:55pm
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>DNS queries are done via UDP. How does a DNS client handle lost UDP
packets (either the query or the reply), since UDP does no retransmission?
</li><li>Due to the requirements of the IP layer, UDP packets may be as small as
576 bytes. What happens to the DNS lookup if the name to look up is longer
than 576 bytes?
</li><li>Can multiple IP addresses have the same domain name? If yes, explain
the motivation behind allowing this. If no, explain why not.
</li><li>Can one IP address be associated with multiple domain names? Explain
why or why not?
</li><li>Email addresses are typically of the form
<code>username@machine.domain</code>. How is DNS used to find the appropriate
mail server for an email address?
</li><li>Why is DNS cache poisoning a concern from a security perspective?
</li><li>What is the purpose of MIME types in email and web page headers? 
</li><li>Describe the difference between IPSec in tunneling mode and in transport
mode.
</li><li>Why is transmission encryption more vital for a wireless link than for a
wired link?
</li><li>A corporation requires that all telecommuters use VPNs to connect from
home to the corporate network. Assume that all VPNs use IPSec in ESP tunnel
mode to connect the user from home to the corporate network, but once inside
the network, standard Ethernet is used to deliver data. Bob the CEO is
at home and wishes to send Alice the VP of Human Resources a memo on who 
will be laid off in the next round of budget cuts. Does Bob need to use 
additional encryption for this memo? Consider who Bob does NOT want to see
the memo and when the memo would be encrypted and when it would be in 
plaintext with the default VPN setup.
