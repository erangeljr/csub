<b>Catalog Description</b><br>
Introduces the fundamentals of procedural programming and. Topics include  
data types, control structures, functions, arrays, and file 
I/O. The mechanics of compiling, linking, running, debugging and testing 
within a particular programming environment are covered. The course also 
indroduces the concepts of object-oriented programming. The course focuses
on the definition and use of classes, and the fundamentals of object-oriented
design [to an extent]. Continuing topics of OOP exist within cmps 2020. 
Ethical issues and an historical perspective of programming within 
the context of computer science as a discipline are given. 
Other topics include an overview of programming language principles, 
basic searching and sorting techniques, and an introduction to software 
engineering issues.

    ABET Outcome Coverage:<br>
    3b.  An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing 
    requirements and specifications appropriate to its solution. 
        Laboratory and homework assignments will require analysis of the 
    problem for successful completion of the assignments. 
    <br>
    
    3c.  An ability to design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, 
    process, component, or program to meet desired needs. An ability to understand 
    the analysis, design, and implementation of a computerized solution to a 
    real-life problem. 
        Laboratory and homework assignments require analyzing the presented 
    problems, designing a solution to those problems, and implementing the 
    solution in a high-level programming language.

There will usually be a brief lecture at the beginning of each lab session.
Roll will be taken during lab. 20% of the lab grade is based on attendance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab Submission</b><br>
All lab files due should be located in your designated folder on Sleipnir.<br>
This area on the Sleipnir server will be set up for you during the 1st week
of class.<br>
Instructions will be gived during the course to help you submit your
